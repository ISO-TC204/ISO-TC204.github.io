### Naming Convention for TC204 Deliverables 
While our document titles may seem a little daunting, they typically use a multi-level naming structure, for example:

<kbd>ISO/TS 14813-1:2015(en) Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector - Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services</kdb>

> [!TIP]
> You may wish to look at a sample of the above technical standard [here](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:14813:-1:ed-2:v1:en)
<br>
While our naming structures have changed over time, new deliverables typically follow the structure as described in the table below...

<!-- Need to resolve the table formating -->
`<Publishing SDO/s>/<Deliverable Type> <Number[-Part]>:<Year of Publication>(<language>) <Title 1> - <Title 2> [ - <Title 3>]`

|<Deliverable Type> |**TS**|The [types of ISO deliverables](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm)|
|<Number[-Part]>|**14813-1**|Unique identifier of the deliverable, which can include an optional *Part* number to indicate they are focussed components detailing a specific aspect. This can also facilitate progressive development and publishing and use of a suite of documents over time.|
|<Year of Publication>|**2015**|Year that the deliverable is formally published and released for use by ISO|
|<language>|**(en)**|Used to distinguish between **en** (English) and **fr** *(*French) editions of a document|
|<Title 1>|**Intelligent transport systems** |Most of our deliverables now use the name of TC204 for the top tier <Title 1>|
|<Title 2>|**Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector**|Key concept|
|<Title 3>|**Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services**|The <Title 3> level is optional, but is frequently used in order to describe specific aspects of the Key concept. Note that “Part 1: “ is considered part of the title|
