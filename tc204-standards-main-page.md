### TC204 Foundational Standards - Architectural Framework
The following standards effectively establish the foundation upon which most other TC204 standards are (or should be) built.

### TC204 Foundational Standards - Integrated Transport Information, Management and Control
The following standards effectively establish the foundation for Integrated Transport Information, Management and Control (commonly referred to as C-ITS Stations and C-ITS Modules).
<br>
#### Scope of standardization
Centers refer to transport management centers. Roadside modules include signal control devices, information boards and sensors installed along roads.

<br>
<br>
#### Definition of data elements and data frames between roadside units and signal controllers for cooperative signal control 
TS 19082
<br>
<br>
#### Communication between centers 
Communication between centers is aimed at information exchange between traffic management centers, in which information collected by one transport management center is exchanged with neighboring centers, enabling the implementation of extensive transport management.

<br>
<br>
#### Interface protocol and message set definition between traffic signal controllers and detectors 
ISO 10711
