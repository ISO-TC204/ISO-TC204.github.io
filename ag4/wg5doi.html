<p>The purpose of WG 5 is to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>support interoperable electronic fee collection (EFC) products and services,</li>
  <li>ease the implementation and operation of EFC schemes and services,</li>
</ul>
<p>by providing standards that support road user charging transport- and vehicle-related fees and access control (including fee collection for parking lots and ferries) and associated processes (end-user compliance checking, localization augmentation communication, OBE configuration and personalization, system testing and conformity assessment etc.).</p>
<p>WG 5 activities include elaboration of standard documents for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reference architecture and related aspects (e.g. enterprise view, vocabulary, data dictionary)</li>
  <li>information security framework, guidelines for protection profiles and security-related mechanisms (data authentication, access credentials, key derivation…)</li>
  <li>DSRC application interface for fee collection and personalization of on-board equipment (OBE), end-user compliance checking and localization augmentation communication etc.</li>
  <li>autonomous (GNSS/CN-based) EFC</li>
  <li>image recognition-based EFC (incl. ANPR aka ALPR) and end-user compliance checking</li>
  <li>information flows between EFC operators (back-office communication between toll chargers and toll service providers)</li> 
  <li>performance indicators - metrics and examination framework</li>
  <li>system and application interface conformity-related assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>WG 5 also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reviews interference studies and investigates interferences of other wireless communication media to DSRC, either on its own or in collaboration with other WGs/standardization bodies,</li>
  <li>reviews, investigates and elaborates standard documents for road transport-related payment means and services (e.g. user identification and payment means based on integrated circuit(s) cards, common transport payment means, EFC as an instrument to support traffic management). This is also performed in collaboration with, interaction with, or support to other WGs/standardization bodies.</li>
