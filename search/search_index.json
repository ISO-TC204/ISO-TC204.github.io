A misbehavior detection system may be integrated directly into a PKI service, such as the SCMS. Misbehavior detection profiles are defined for specific message types (for example, Basic Safety Messages), in order to identify unexpected behavior from a device. When a receiving device detects unusual behavior, the device can flag that behavior by transmiting a misbehavior report to the PKI for review. The PKI can then determine the most appropriate course of action, to include revoking the offending device's certificates, suspending its certifictes, or other approaches. </p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/system-specific-security/#secure-messaging-protocols-and-capabilities","title":"Secure Messaging Protocols and Capabilities","text":"<p>Information exchanged between vehicles, roadside units, Traffic Management Centers (TMCs) and other entities must be authenticated and integrity protected. PKI systems such as the SCMS and CCMS provide the underlying certificates that are used to acheive these security objectives. Security protocols must also be used, along with these certificates. In ITS systems, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used protocol that provides encryption and secure communication over networks, safeguarding data from eavesdropping and tampering. In the context of ITS, ISO 21177 specifies security services for ITS stations, including secure session establishment and authentication between trusted devices, utilizing protocols like TLS to ensure the authenticity and integrity of information exchanged. </p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/system-specific-security/#cross-domain-trust","title":"Cross Domain Trust","text":"<p>Cross-domain trust is essential for seamless interoperability within ITS systems in order to ensure secure and reliable communication across different jurisdictions and administrative domains. In the U.S., the IEEE 1609.2.2 standard addresses multi-jurisdictional interoperability by defining mechanisms that enable trust between devices using digital certificates issued under different policy domains. A key component of this approach uses the Certificate Trust List (CTL) with entries for trust permissions associated with each trusted Root CA or SCMS. This allows SCMS Managers to granularly establish and manage trust relationships across multiple trusted domains. </p> <p>In Europe, the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) employs the European C-ITS Security Credential Management System (EU CCMS) to manage cross-domain trust. This is acheived using the C-ITS Point of Contact (CPOC) protocol, which facilitates the collection of Root CA certificates and their placement onto the European Certificate Trust List (ECTL). The Trust List Manager (TLM) is responsible for issuing the ECTL, ensuring that all participating entities adhere to a unified trust model. </p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/system-specific-security/#learn-more","title":"Learn More","text":"<p>SCMS CPOC ISO 21177 TLS</p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/trust-bridges/","title":"Trust Bridges: Secure Information Sharing Across Independent Domains","text":""},{"location":"cybersecurity/trust-bridges/#introduction-to-trust-bridges","title":"Introduction to Trust Bridges","text":"<p>Trust bridges are mechanisms that enable the secure sharing of information between two independent trust domains.
