Interoperability ensures that connected devices, for example vehicles crossing jurisdictional lines or roadside units supporting multiple jurisdictions, can recognize and validate each other\u2019s messages reliably.</p> <p>Interoperability becomes especially important in contexts where operational coordination spans multiple entities.

The goal is to ensure that messages originating from one domain can be validated and trusted by another without sacrificing security or requiring proprietary solutions.

This signals to end entities in the local domain that certificates chaining back to the listed Root CA are recognized and valid for use, as long as the trust conditions associated with that Root CA are met.</p> <p>IEEE 1609.2.2 adds the ability to assign trust permissions to each Root CA listed on the CTL. These permissions define exactly what a receiving end entity should trust when it encounters a certificate from an external domain. Permissions can be specified in several ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By listing which ITS-AID/PSID are trusted or untrusted.</p> </li> <li> <p>By stating whether fields like opOrgId or encryptionKey in the certificate should be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These permissions provide fine-grained control. For example, an SCMS Manager can trust a foreign Root CA for the purpose of receiving basic safety messages but indicate that it does not trust the opOrgId field due to differences in organizational vetting procedures.

The receiving entity uses these trust permissions to evaluate messages and ensure that certificates are only accepted for the purposes explicitly permitted by the local CTL.</p> <p>IEEE 1609.2.2 enables interoperability between policy domains without requiring them to adopt identical certificate enrolment and other policies.

In Europe, the Cooperative ITS Credential Management System (CCMS) is managed centrally by a Certificate Policy Authority (CPA), which governs the European Certificate Trust List (ECTL). Root CAs seeking to be included in the ECTL must conform to the harmonized CP, and compliance is enforced through audit and assessment.</p> <p>Both SCMS and CCMS models rely on CP/CPS documents to ensure that only eligible devices are authorized to participate in ITS communications, that certificates are properly managed across their lifecycle, and that misbehavior can be detected and acted upon.

This is typically done by evaluating the likelihood of a threat using factors like required exploitation time, required expertise, opportunity, and equipment. Calculating threat likelihood can be accomplished through an analysis using the following table:</p> <p>Table 4.ITS Threat Likelihood Scoring Table</p> Likelihood Description Low There are strong technical barriers to the implementation of the threat and/or the motivations for a threat actor are very low. Medium There are low technical barriers to the implementation of the threat and/or there are reasonable motivations for a threat actor. High There are low technical barriers to the implementation of the threat and/or there are high motivations for a threat actor. <p>The impact of a threat is determined by the consequences of a successful attack, such as the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</p> <p>Table 5.ITS Threat Impact Scoring Table</p> Impact Description Low There is minimal degradation to ITS operations and minimal data integrity degradation/loss in the event of a security incident. Medium There is moderate degradation to ITS operations and/or moderate data integrity degradation/loss in the event of a security incident. High There is major degradation to ITS operations and/or major data integrity degradation/loss in the event of a security incident."},{"location":"cybersecurity/threat-analysis/#determining-acceptable-risk","title":"Determining Acceptable Risk","text":"<p>The decision to mitigate a threat or accept its risk is a core component of any cybersecurity strategy. A threat may be considered \"acceptable\" and not require mitigation if its resulting risk score is below a predefined threshold set by the organization.

The cost-benefit analysis evaluates the financial and operational trade-offs of each threat between the threat risk and the cost of the applicable threat countermeasures. For each threat in the TVRA threat and risk analysis, decision must be made to either mitigate the threat, or accept the associated threat risk.</p> <p>Threat mitigation is often appropriate for threats that have a high or critical risk score. Mitigation involves implementing cybersecurity controls and best practices to reduce either the likelihood or the impact of the threat.</p> <p>Accepting a threat risk means making a conscious and informed decision to not implement cybersecurity controls. This is typically done for threats with a low (or sometimes moderate) risk score, where the cost of mitigation is higher than the potential impact of the event.</p> <p>It is rare that an organization with have enough resources available to mitigate all identified risks. This is where the importance of risk prioritization plays a role. By following this systematic process, organizations can allocate their limited resources strategically, focusing on protecting what matters most while making informed decisions about threats that pose a minimal or acceptable level of risk.</p> <p>The key to a consistent approach is to define a clear risk acceptance threshold. This is a business-level decision, not a technical one, that sets the maximum level of risk the organization is willing to tolerate. Any threat with a risk score above this threshold requires mitigation, while those below may be considered for acceptance.</p> <p>By prioritizing threats by risk score in the TVRA threat and risk analysis list, This threshold can then be mapped against an organization\u2019s currently available resources. Ideally an organization\u2019s available resources will align with the risk mitigation threshold. Threats above the threshold will have resources allocated for mitigation. Threats below the threshold will not have resources made available and the risk from these threats will be accepted. If there is a misalignment between an organization\u2019s risk threshold and available resources, the TVRA process provides a quantitative analysis for any resulting organizational budgetary and policy discussions.</p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/threat-analysis/#list-of-references-and-resources","title":"List of References and Resources","text":"<ul> <li> <p>ITS Cybersecurity Pattern</p> </li> <li> <p>MITRE ATT\\&amp;CK Framework</p> </li> <li> <p>ETSI TS 102 165-1</p> </li> <li> <p>ETSI TR 102 893</p> </li> <li> <p>NIST Special Publication 800-30</p> </li> <li> <p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</p> </li> <li> <p>ARC-IT ITS CSF Profile</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"jwg1/","title":"City data model: Transport (ISO TC 204 JWG 1)","text":""},{"location":"jwg1/#domain-of-interest","title":"Domain of interest","text":"<p>The purpose of JWG1 is to develop transportation-related data models that inherit from the ISO/IEC 5087 series.
