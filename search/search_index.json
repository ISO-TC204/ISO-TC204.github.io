For example, North American deployments often rely on SCMS for certificate management, while European systems use the CCMS.

Use this page to identify which standards support core cybersecurity functions, such as certificate management, authenticated messaging, or permission enforcement. For example, implementing secure V2X requires applying standards like ISO 21177, IEEE 1609.2, and/or ETSI TS 103 097 to handle certificate validation and message protection.

Performing an ITS Threat Analysis","text":"<p>The selection of cybersecurity controls to protect the ITS confidentiality, integrity and availability should be risk-informed, meaning that organizations that operate (e.g,. Infrastructure Owner Operators (IOOs)) an ITS should conduct a comprehensive threat analysis in order to understand the ITS's  risk profile. This threat analysis should be methodical, guided by a standard approach to performing threat and risk assessments.  Threat analysis often involves development of a profile of the ITS system assets, communication data flows, trust boundaries, and communication interfaces. Once this information is well understood and documented, threats and vulnerabilities can be identified for each asset or data flow. From there, an estimate of the likelihood and impact of different risks to the system can be calculated and appropriate mitigations can be identified. This allows cybersecurity executives within an ITS organization to prioritize the most appropriate cybersecurity controls given the risk profile and operational context of the system.</p> <p>Several frameworks exist to guide the threat analysis process, depending on regional context. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In Europe, threat analysis activities are often shaped by ETSI TR 102 893, a technical report that provides a structured approach for assessing risks in cooperative ITS environments. European station operators and manufacturers are also expected to conduct and maintain operational risk assessments in alignment with ISO/IEC 27005, as outlined in the CCMS Security Policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In North America, threat analysis is typically informed by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the ITS Cybersecurity Profile, which together provide a foundation for identifying risks and applying controls across systems such as Dynamic Message Signs, Closed-Circuit Television cameras, RSUs and other systems.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/#4-interoperability-strategies","title":"4.

ITS Standards Developers, Policy-Makers, and Implementers have options for enabling seamless trusted interoperability. For example, at a national level policy-makers may choose to harmonize policies across multiple jurisdictions. There are technical options available as well. For example,  IEEE Std. 1609.2.2 provides a mechanism whereby specific trust permissions can be allocated to Root Certificate Authorities (Root CAs) using a PKI's Certificate Trust List (CTL).

Threats may include unauthorized access, spoofing, message manipulation, denial-of-service, physical tampering, among others. Leverage tools such as the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework for a better understanding of attack types, and understand that attacks are often strung together in order to achieve greater effect.  </li> <li>Evaluate Risk:  Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each threat materializing, taking into account the environment in which the system operates.

Control selection should reflect both the risk profile and the system\u2019s functional requirements. Review the ITS Cybersecurity Controls page for more information on possible control selection.</li> <li>Document and Reassess:  Maintain records of the analysis, including identified threats, rationale for control selection, and residual risks.

IoT devices such as smart traffic signals, cameras, and sensors may be physically or remotely exploited due to weak default configurations or unpatched software. Location-based services can be compromised through GPS spoofing and jamming, causing vehicles to misreport their positions or lose navigation capability. As cyber-physical systems, ITS deployments must defend not just against digital exploits, but against threats that have direct safety consequences in the physical world\u2014from manipulating emergency vehicle priority to triggering unsafe driving conditions.
