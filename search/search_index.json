To minimize your wait time, please advise the Secretariat with  your sufficient detail of your issue to assist the WG Convenor provide you an informed  initial response.</p> <p>2. What\u2019s meant by ITS Architecture?</p> <p>Answer: An ITS architecture represents the fundamental concepts and properties of an intelligent transport system within a defined environment with its embodied components, relationships, and principles of design and evolution. Technically, each system has an own architecture, whether documented or not. Documentation describing an architecture is often called an \"architecture\", although the more precise term for the documentation is \"architecture description\". Standardization promotes the concept of adopting similar architecture designs across multiple systems. A generalized description that describes the architecture used by multiple systems is also often referred to as an \"architecture\" although the more precise term is a \"reference architecture\".</p> <p>4. What\u2019s an ITS Station?</p> <p>Answer: An ITS station is a component within an intelligent transport system that performs ITS-related application processing and meets key security requirements to be considered part of the ITS trust domain.</p> <p>5. Is there a consolidated list of terms and their definitions?</p> <p>Answer: ISO/TC 204 has developed ISO/TS 14812 Intelligent transport systems \u2014 Vocabulary. This collates definitions from a wide range of sources across ISO and other external entities. These definitions can be found online for free on the Online Browsing Platform.</p> <p>6. What\u2019s an Object Identifier (OID)?  Is there a consolidated list?</p> <p>Answer: An object identifier is a decentralized, globally unique identifier that can be assigned to identify any type of object (e.g., an information item in a message, a document, an encoding scheme). The assignment of identifiers to a meaning is decentralized; this is achieved by the assignment of three root nodes managed by ISO, ITU-T, and a third managed jointly by ISO and ITU-T, each of which is assigned a number and a name. Nodes under the three root nodes are assigned by those organizations and the management of each such node can be assigned to a different entity. Each level of the object identifier tree, except for the root and second level, can have an infinite number of nodes and there can be an infinite number of levels. As a result, any entity can request a new node and then assign their own identifiers to their own objects underneath that node. Within TC 204, we are in the process of establishing our own registry for identifier nodes.</p> <p>7. What\u2019s an Application Identifier (ITS-AID)?  Is there a consolidated list?</p> <p>Answer: An ITS Application Identifier (ITS-AID) is an identifier given to an ITS application so that its messages can be recognized in electronic communications. The identifiers are managed within the Registry for ITS Identifiers (RITSI).</p> <p>8. What\u2019s the difference between an AID and OID?</p> <p>Answer: An ITS-AID is used specifically to identify an ITS application in electronic communications. An OID can be used identify any object (including an ITS application, if desired) for any purpose (for which an OID can be recognized).</p> <p>9.What\u2019s ASN.1 and why should I care?</p> <p>Answer: Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard for defining data structures in a precise manner without having to detail the detailed encoding. ASN.1 includes its own set of encoding rules for different styles (e.g., basic, octet-aligned, packed, XML, JSON). The advantage of ASN.1 is that it provides a precise and unambiguous definition of a data structure that can be easily validated and compiled into code resulting in more interoperable implementations.</p>"},{"location":"foundational/","title":"Foundational concepts","text":""},{"location":"foundational/#tc-204-foundational-standards","title":"TC 204 Foundational Standards","text":"<p>The following standards effectively establish the foundation upon which most other TC204 standards are (or should be) built.

The components that make up an ITS may be installed in fixed locations, or may be \"on-the-move\".  Mobile ITS components may enter and leave policy domains frequently, resulting in the need for a dynamic trust model whereby trust is not provisioned between components a priori, but instead dynamically. The complexity of an ITS is well suited by the term \"System of Systems (SoS)\".

It is not sufficient for vehicles from OEM A to receive and process messages from OEM B and vice versa. OEM A's vehicles must be able to trust that the messages coming from vehicles produced by OEM B are authentic and integrity protected. This    requires the use of a trusted third party, known as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  A PKI provider adheres to specific polices and procedures to ensure that any person, system or device that is issued a certificate, meets a minimum set of assurances and has sufficiently proven its identity. In the example above, vehicles from both OEM A and OEM B may be issued certificates by the same PKI, meaning that all vehicles operate within a single trust domain. </p> <p>There are multiple PKI providers that server ITS's across the globe. This requires that there also be interoperability strategies put into place between the PKI providers themselves, to ensure that the trust associated with certificates issued by PKI Provider 1 is equivalent to the trust associated with certificates issued by PKI Provider n. One way to accomplish this is to ensure that the polices that each PKI provider operates by, are harmonized. Another method to accomplish this, is to engineer technical solutions. For example, in North America, IEEE 1609.2.2 (DRAFT) provides a mechanism whereby PKI Provider 1 establish conditional trust with PKI Provider 2, for example by allowing trust for BSMs but not for messages that request priority services. </p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/#5-device-and-application-security-policy-recommendations","title":"5.

In critical infrastructure sectors such as transportation, cybersecurity controls also impact the physical world, since exploitation of ITS devices or services could result in kinetic effects. Successful exploitation of system weaknesses and vulnerabilities could could disrupt traffic signals, disable roadside infrastructure, or compromise the CV data feeds, resulting in on-road collisions.  The cybersecurity principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability are used within a secure system design to safeguard against these threats. </p> <p></p> <p>Confidentiality requirements may be levied on an ITS to protect data from unauthorized access. For example, by encrypting information contained within digital messages, an attacker that has access to those messages will not be able to read them. The ITS domain is somewhat unique in that many ITS messages, for example V2V messages, do not require confidentiality protections because they contain information that is meant to be broadcast to surrounding vehicles. Confidentiality is enabled through encryption algorithms (for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)), key exchange algorithms (for example, Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH)), and by the protection of cryptographic keys used by these and other algorithms. </p> <p>Maintaining the integrity of ITS messages is always important. Vehicles and ITS systems may perform actions based on the contents of a digital message.  Therefore, data integrity requirements are levied on an ITS to safeguard against the unauthorized modification of data whether in-transit or at-rest.  Data integrity can be enabled within an ITS through the use of approaches such as Message Authentication Codes (MACs), hashing algorithms, and /or digital signature algorithms. For example, an ITS developer may choose to append a keyed MAC to a message, whereby a tag is created by combining the message with a secret key, before running through a hashing algorithm. In this case, the secret key is shared between two parties. An alternative to this approach is to use digital certificates and asymmetric key pairs.  IEEE Std. 1609.2 defines certificates that can be used to validate both the integrity and authenticity of ITS messages. A sender may use a hashing algorithm, for example Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) to hash message contents, and then apply a digital signature to the hash, using algorithms such as Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Receivers can then use the public key of the sender, contained within the IEEE 1609.2 certificate, to validate that the message was signed by a trusted entity, and that the contents of the message have not been tampered. </p> <p>Authentication is also critical within  an ITS. As mentioned above, approaches such as IEEE 1609.2 can be used to authenticate that the sender of a message is (1) the actual sender of that message, and (2) is trusted by the receiver to send that message.  Note that this is different than validating that the sender of a message is authorized to send the message. Within an ITS, the ability to validate authorization is also important, and to do so, sender certificates may include one or more Provider Service Identifiers (PSIDs) and Service Specific Permissions (SSPs). These entitlements communicate to the receiver of a message, what specifically that the sender is authorized to request or perform.  </p> <p>The principle of availability within a cybersecurity design focuses on ensuring that ITS systems and services remain operational and accessible when needed. In transportation, these principles apply to traffic control commands, vehicle messaging, digital road signage, and other systems.</p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/beginners-guide/#its-cybersecurity","title":"ITS Cybersecurity","text":"<p>Modern ITS environments face a broad and evolving threat landscape.

As connected vehicles and infrastructure begin to operate across jurisdictions and trust domains, enabling interoperability becomes essential for safe and reliable communication.</p> <p>As ITS are increasingly deployed across cities, regions, and national borders, secure communication between vehicles and infrastructure must be maintained even when those systems operate under different governance models and trust frameworks. Interoperability ensures that connected devices, for example vehicles crossing jurisdictional lines or roadside units supporting multiple jurisdictions, can recognize and validate each other\u2019s messages reliably.</p> <p>Interoperability becomes especially important in contexts where operational coordination spans multiple entities. This includes for example metropolitan planning organizations managing smart intersections, regional agencies operating roadside units, or national governments deploying connected vehicle credentials. Each may have its own policies, security credentials, and trust authorities, but their systems must work together seamlessly. Without an interoperability framework, safety-critical messages, such as vehicle warnings or signal phase and timing information may go unrecognized or untrusted.</p> <p>Effective strategies for achieving interoperability include establishing mutual trust relationships, using common message standards, aligning policy enforcement, and supporting devices that can operate within multiple trust domains. The goal is to ensure that messages originating from one domain can be validated and trusted by another without sacrificing security or requiring proprietary solutions. The following sections outline technical and policy-based approaches that support interoperability in the real world, including the role of standards like IEEE 1609.2.2 and the harmonization of certificate policies across trust domains.</p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/its-interoperability-strategies/#multi-jurisdictional-trust-with-ieee-160922","title":"Multi-Jurisdictional Trust with IEEE 1609.2.2","text":"<p>IEEE 1609.2.2 introduces a framework for establishing trust across security domains that operate under different policies, using the Certificate Trust List (CTL). The CTL enumerates Root Certificate Authorities (Root CAs) that the local system recognizes as trusted. Trust is extended by placing the hashed identifier of a Root CA (HashedId32) onto the CTL. This signals to end entities in the local domain that certificates chaining back to the listed Root CA are recognized and valid for use, as long as the trust conditions associated with that Root CA are met.</p> <p>IEEE 1609.2.2 adds the ability to assign trust permissions to each Root CA listed on the CTL. These permissions define exactly what a receiving end entity should trust when it encounters a certificate from an external domain. Permissions can be specified in several ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>By listing which ITS-AID/PSID are trusted or untrusted.</p> </li> <li> <p>By stating whether fields like opOrgId or encryptionKey in the certificate should be used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These permissions provide fine-grained control. For example, an SCMS Manager can trust a foreign Root CA for the purpose of receiving basic safety messages but indicate that it does not trust the opOrgId field due to differences in organizational vetting procedures. This model allows a system operator to define exactly what it accepts from each external trust domain. The receiving entity uses these trust permissions to evaluate messages and ensure that certificates are only accepted for the purposes explicitly permitted by the local CTL.</p> <p>IEEE 1609.2.2 enables interoperability between policy domains without requiring them to adopt identical certificate enrolment and other policies. It provides a mechanism for trust to be extended in a controlled and explicit way, supporting cross-border or cross-organizational communication while respecting local assurance requirements.</p>"},{"location":"cybersecurity/its-misuse-cases/","title":"ITS Cybersecurity Misuse Cases","text":"<p>Misuse cases show how attackers can chain multiple threats to disrupt ITS operations.

As with MonthlyRecurringEvent, there may be ambiguity regarding the semantics of a yearly recurring event, however this formalization captures only the notion of an event that recurs on the same day of the same month (e.g. a birthday). https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# beginsRecurringState object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# beginsRecurringTime object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# endDayOfWeek object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# endMonth object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# endTime datatype_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# endsRecurringState object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# endsRecurringTime object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# hasDayOfWeek object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# hasMonth object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# hasOccurrence object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# hasSubRecurringEvent object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# onDateTimeDescription object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# recurringEventDataProperty datatype_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# recurringEventProperty object_property Property added for organizational purposes only; to group all object properties defined in the recurring event ontology. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# recursAddition object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# recursExcept object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# startTime datatype_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# timeOntologyDataProperty datatype_property Data property added for organizational purposes only; to group all data properties defined in the time ontology. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# timeOntologyProperty object_property Property added for organizational purposes only; to group all object properties defined in the time ontology. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# ConsumeState class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# DivisibleResource class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# PlannedAllocation class Specifies the planned allocation of a resource to an activity via a state. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# ProduceState class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# ReleaseState class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# Resource class A Resource is a generic representation of some Thing that can be \"used\" in an Activity. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# ResourceOntologyProperty object_property Added for organizational purposes, to identify all properties defined in the Resource ontology. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# ResourceOntologyThing class Added for organizational purposes, to identify all classes defined in the Resource ontology. https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# TerminalResourceState class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# UseState class https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# capacityInUse object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# consumedBy object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# forResource object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# forState object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# hasAllocation object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# hasAsset object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# hasAvailableCapacity object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# hasCapacity object_property https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/Resource# hasOwner object_property A Resource may have some owner.

The system monitors the driving environment in the adjacent lanes and operates the SV by adjusting the speed and lateral position to move the SV to the intended lane. MCS may delay the manoeuvre until the conditions for initiating the lane change are satisfied or cancel the lane change when conditions are not satisfied. Activation of the DLC requires an engaged MCS performing in-lane driving.

One way to achieve this is to define an identifier (e.g., an integer value) that can be used to concisely represent a specific meaning (e.g., the reference to a country, a standard, a protocol). The identifier might be an integer, a hierarchical structure (e.g., an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER), a textual name, or any other concise representation (e.g., a two-character country code).</p> <p>The mappings of identifiers to their precise meanings is provided by a list of registered items. A list of registered items is presented as a table with columns representing different attributes of each registered item and each row associating a specific registered item with its assigned identifier and other attributes (e.g. date of registration).</p> <p>Separate lists of registered items allow the same code (e.g., an integer value of '1') to be assigned different meanings in different contexts; these separate lists are known as item classes. ISO/TC 204 has identified the need for multiple item classes. Whenever a standard provides a field that can be used to reference a registered item, it must identify the item class (i.e., the specific list of registered items) to be used when populating the field.</p> <p>Some lists of registered items are relatively static and are only updated when the text of the standard is updated. However, within ITS, several of these lists need to be updated in a more timely manner. ISO/TC 204 developed ISO 5345 to define the process for maintaining such lists.

An agreement may be defined at varying levels of detail, this is supported with the introduction of the ComplexAgreement and AtomicAgreement class. A complex agreement may be decomposed into sub-agreements, whereas an atomic agreement cannot. Similar to the approach taken for the representation of activities, a complex agreement may be decomposed into disjunctive or conjunctive sub-agreements. This allows for the representation of both types of agreement composition. At their most simple level, the AtomicAgreement describes a commitment to some activity; this is captured with the commitsToActivity property.  Finally, agreements involve some specification of rights or commitments of the involved parties. This is represented as a relationship between the involved Agent and a particular activity. The precise nature of the relationship indicates the type of agreement.

For example, a Vehicle will have one location at one time, and another location at a later time; it may have only one passenger at one time, and four passengers at a later time. Similarly, many attributes of Persons, Households, and even Transportation Networks are subject to change. An approach to representing changing properties, or fluents, that leverages the 4-dimensionalist perspective was proposed by (Welty, Fikes, and Makarios, 2006). We adopt a similar approach, based on a re-interpretation by Krieger (2008) requiring the division of classes that are subject to change into two parts: invariant and variant parts of the concept; we refer to these as TimeVaryingConcept and Manifestation classes, respectively. By distinguishing between these class types and recognizing the properties that are (and aren't) subject to change, the ontology supports the capture of both the static and dynamic aspects of a particular entity. </p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Change Ontology Thing (Change)</li> <li>First Manifestation (Change)</li> <li>Manifestation (Change)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-1/v1-0-1/#icity-resource-ontology","title":"iCity Resource Ontology","text":"<p>This ontology provides a generic representation of resources that contain core properties generic across all transportation uses. We take the view presented in the TOVE model (Fadel, Fox, and Gruninger, 1994) that \"...being a resource is not an innate property of an object but a property that is derived from the role the object plays with respect to an activity\". The definition of  a resource is dependent on its participation in an activity occurrence, so the Resource ontology is in fact an extension of the Activity ontology. In this sense, Resources are a class of manifestations, so that rather than have a specialized Resource-perdurant (PD) class, a Resource is a manifestation of some other perdurant class in the ontology. For example, an instance of a Vehicle that is a manifestation of some VehiclePD may also be an instance of a resource, whereas some other instance of a Vehicle that is some later manifestation of the same VehiclePD may not be a Resource, or it may be a different Resource. </p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Consume State (Resource)</li> <li>Divisible Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Non Divisible Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Planned Allocation (Resource)</li> <li>Produce State (Resource)</li> <li>Release State (Resource)</li> <li>Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Resource Ontology Thing (Resource)</li> <li>Terminal Resource State (Resource)</li> <li>Use State (Resource)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-1/v1-0-1/#iso-5087-1-provenance-pattern","title":"ISO 5087-1 Provenance Pattern","text":"<p>Ontology to capture concepts related to provenance.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Activity (Prov)</li> <li>Agent (Prov)</li> <li>Prov Ontology Thing (Prov)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-1/v1-0-1/#mereology-ontology","title":"Mereology Ontology","text":"<p>Ontology to capture concepts related to parthood.

The main difference between a by-law and a law passed by a national/federal or regional/state body is that a by-law is made by a non-sovereign body, which derives its authority from another governing body, and can only be made on a limited range of matters. A local council or municipal government derives its power to pass laws through a law of the national or regional government which specifies what things the town or city may regulate through by-laws. It is therefore a form of delegated legislation.\u201d (Wikipedia, 2020) \u201cA municipal by-law is no different than any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court and must comply with higher levels of law. Municipal bylaws are often enforceable through the public justice system, and offenders can be charged with a criminal offence for breach of a bylaw.\u201d (Alberta, 2017) The intent of the Bylaw ontology is to capture the major components of a city bylaw, such as dates, geographic areas of application, penalties, etc. It is not intended to provide a legal semantics with which to codify a particular bylaw. The following three types of bylaws are represented in the Bylaw Ontology (Alberta, 2017):  1.  Main bylaws;  2.

They may own it, rent it or just stay in it.  Legally, \u201creside means to dwell permanently or continuously. It expresses an idea that a person keeps or returns to a particular dwelling place as his fixed, settled, or legal abode. The meaning of reside implies a continuous arrangement\u201d ; reside has both a temporal and spatial dimension.

ITSPattern","text":"Class Description Micromobility Network Pattern (transportnetwork) The micromobility network pattern specializes the road network pattern to address the needs for the travel of micromobility vehicles. Pedestrian Network Pattern (transportnetwork) The pedestrian network pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for pedestrian travel. Public Transport System Pattern (transportnetwork) The public transport system pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for public transport travel. Whereas the transport network pattern focuses on infrastructure, the public transport system pattern focuses on the operations that rely on the infrastructure provided by the transport networks. Rail Network Pattern (transportnetwork) The rail network pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for travel of rail vehicles (e.g., trains, subways, trams). Road Network Pattern (transportnetwork) The road network pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for vehicular travel. Road networks that are primarily designed for the movement of micromobility vehicles should generally be defined using the micromobility network pattern, which is a specialization of this pattern. Transport Alert Pattern (transportnetwork) The transport alert pattern addresses the need for public agencies to alert groups to unusual transport-related conditions. Most of the features of the transport alert pattern can also be used for other types of alerts (e.g., meteorological events) and as such, its design includes the definition of a generalized alert. Transport Network Pattern (transportnetwork) The Transport Network Pattern models the core concepts involved in describing a transport network. This includes an identification of both physical and administrative characteristics. The most general class is that of the NetworkElement, which can be further classified as one of several types of NetworkElements. <p>A key feature of this pattern is the formalization of the hasProperPart relationship from a NetworkElement to another NetworkElement. This allows for a representation of networks at multiple levels of detail. For example, at one level, a motorway interchange can be modelled as a single Node. But that node is a NetworkElement that can be defined to consist of an entire TransportNetwork that has a node for each junction within the interchange. | | Travel Corridor Pattern (transportnetwork) | The travel corridor pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for a more holistic travel view.

Travel Corridor Link A TravelCorridorLink is a type of TravelledWayLink that is made up of TravelCorridorSegments. Travel Corridor Segment A TravelCorridorSegment is a type of TravelledWaySegment that logically groups multiple TravelledWaySegments together as being co-located or side-by-side. Travelled Way A TravelledWay is a type of NetworkElement and transinfras:TravelledWay that represents the curvilinear length of a transport route that is identified by a specific designator. Travelled Way Lane A TravelledWayLane is a NetworkElement that is a portion of TravelledWaySegment intended to accommodate a single line of moving material entities (e.g., vehicles) along its length. Travelled Way Link A TravelledWayLink is a type of NetworkElement and transinfras:TravelledWayLink. It represents a contiguous length of a TravelledWay between two TransportNodes of operational or managerial significance. Travelled Way Section A TravelledWaySection is a type of NetworkElement that represents an aggregation of TravelledWayLinks and TravelledWaySegments that jointly represent a contiguous length of a path that shares the same management and operational strategies (within the scope of interest of the implementation). Travelled Way Segment A TravelledWaySegment is a type of a transinfras:TravelledWaySegment and NetworkElement that represents a contiguous length of a TravelledWayLink characterized by the same physical characteristics."},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__NetworkElement/#formalization-for-networkelement","title":"Formalization for NetworkElement","text":"Property Constraint genProp::hasIdentifier all xsd::string genProp::hasIdentifier exactly 1 owl::Thing partwhole::hasProperPart all NetworkElement partwhole::properPartOf all NetworkElement status all ScheduledCode subClassOf ITSThing subClassOf geo::Feature"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__NetworkElement/#used-by-classes","title":"Used by classes","text":"Class Property Network Element partwhole::hasProperPart Network Element partwhole::properPartOf Transport Alert affects"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__NetworkElement/#other-annotations","title":"Other annotations","text":"Annotation Value protege::abstract true xsd::pattern TransportNetworkPattern"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PedestrianNetworkPattern/","title":"Pedestrian Network Pattern","text":"<p>The pedestrian network pattern specializes the transport network pattern to address the needs for pedestrian travel.</p> <p>It consists of the following classes:</p> <ul> <li>Footpath</li> <li>Footpath Lane</li> <li>Footpath Link</li> <li>Footpath Network</li> <li>Footpath Section</li> <li>Footpath Segment</li> </ul>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PointOnRoute/","title":"PointOnRoute","text":"<p>A PointOnRoute represents an ordered RoutePoint for a PublicTransportRoute.</p> <p></p> <p>Open interactive PointOnRoute diagram</p>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PointOnRoute/#formalization-for-pointonroute","title":"Formalization for PointOnRoute","text":"Property Constraint index all xsd::integer index exactly 1 owl::Thing point all RoutePoint point exactly 1 owl::Thing routePointType all code::Code subClassOf PublicTransportElement"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PointOnRoute/#used-by-classes","title":"Used by classes","text":"Class Property Public Transport Route points"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PointOnRoute/#other-annotations","title":"Other annotations","text":"Annotation Value xsd::pattern PublicTransportSystemPattern"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PublicTransportElement/","title":"PublicTransportElement","text":"<p>Open interactive PublicTransportElement diagram</p>"},{"location":"registries/ritso/city-data-model/part-3/v1-0-0/classes/transportnetwork__PublicTransportElement/#specializations-of-publictransportelement","title":"Specializations of PublicTransportElement","text":"Class Description Group Of Lines A GroupOfLines is a logical grouping of PublicTransportLines for any useful purpose.
