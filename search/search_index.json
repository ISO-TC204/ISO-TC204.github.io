This includes securing communication between vehicles and infrastructure, ensuring that only trusted devices participate in ITS applications, and protecting sensitive data from misuse or exposure.</p> <p>Modern ITS environments face a broad and evolving threat landscape. Communications between vehicles and infrastructure\u2014known as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)\u2014must be protected from interception, manipulation, and unauthorized injection of false data. Network infrastructure is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) and malware-based attacks, which can disable roadside systems or overwhelm traffic management centers. IoT devices such as smart traffic signals, cameras, and sensors may be physically or remotely exploited due to weak default configurations or unpatched software. Location-based services can be compromised through GPS spoofing and jamming, causing vehicles to misreport their positions or lose navigation capability. As cyber-physical systems, ITS deployments must defend not just against digital exploits, but against threats that have direct safety consequences in the physical world\u2014from manipulating emergency vehicle priority to triggering unsafe driving conditions. The following diagram provides a simplified view of the types of threats that can affect different components of the ITS environment.</p> <p></p> <p>Unlike traditional internet-based systems, ITS cybersecurity must function in highly mobile, latency-sensitive environments where anonymity of participants is often important. Vehicles must trust messages from other vehicles or roadside systems they have never encountered before\u2014often with no direct internet connection or central authority available at the time of interaction. As a result, ITS requires specialized cybersecurity tools and protocols that go beyond traditional cybersecurity tools such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates.

These differences have led to the development of an ITS-specific cybersecurity stack\u2014designed for decentralized communication, scalability, privacy, and performance in dynamic environments. The following comparison outlines where each stack is typically applied, and highlights why the ITS cybersecurity stack is better suited for securing V2X and transportation-specific use cases.</p> <p>Many of the critical differences between traditional internet security and ITS cybersecurity come down to one key architectural choice: the certificate format.
