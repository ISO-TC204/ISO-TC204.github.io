<p>The purpose of JWG1 is to develop transportation-related data models that inherit from the ISO/IEC 5087 series. This includes any data model that is intended for use in a ‘smart city’ concept, where the data in question is shared beyond the transportation domain.</p>

</p>JWG1 activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying transportation data defined in TC204 that might be relevant outside the transportation domain</li>
<li>Defining transportation data of external interest in a format conforming to the patterns established in ISO/IEC 5087-1, 5087-2</li>
</ul>
