  <p>The purpose of WG10 is to address the timely delivery of
  accurate, relevant information to road users and travellers
  (end-users), in a form suitable for them to use. This encompasses
  the broad range of travel modes in urban and interurban areas
  using different communication means. End-users should have easy
  access to complete information about their travel alternatives
  and accurate information on current and expected road and travel
  conditions to enhance their mobility. Part of the work items are
  developed in common with CEN/TC 278/WG 4 “Traffic and traveller
  information”.</p>
  <p>WG 10 activities include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The Alert-C standards for RDS-TMC (ISO 14819 series) for
  traffic information dissemination using analogic radio (FM);</li>
  <li>The TPEG standards and specifications for different types of
  bearers. It may be used by digital radios (DAB/DMB) and connected
  services with the Internet. Two generations have been
  published:</li>
  <li>The first generation with the ISO/TS 18234 series for binary
  content and the 24530 series for XML-based content;</li>
  <li>The second generation that has superseded the first one with
  the ISO 21219 series.</li>
  <li>The graphical data dictionary (ISO 14823 series) that intends
  to propose a system of standardised codes for existing road
  traffic signs and pictograms used to deliver traffic and
  traveller information. The coding system can be used in the
  formation of messages within intelligent transport systems.</li>
