 <p>The purpose of WG 5 is to</p>
 <ul>
  <li>support interoperable electronic fee collection (EFC)
  products and services,</li>
  <li>ease the implementation and operation of EFC schemes and
  services,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>by providing standards that support road user charging
  transport- and vehicle-related fees and access control (including
  fee collection for parking lots and ferries) and associated
  processes (end-user compliance checking, localization
  augmentation communication, OBE configuration and
  personalization, system testing and conformity assessment
  etc.).</p>
  <p>WG 5 activities include elaboration of standard documents
  for:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>reference architecture and related aspects (e.g. enterprise
  view, vocabulary, data dictionary)</li>
  <li>information security framework, guidelines for protection
  profiles and security-related mechanisms (data authentication,
  access credentials, key derivationâ€¦)</li>
  <li>DSRC application interface for fee collection and
  personalization of on-board equipment (OBE), end-user compliance
  checking and localization augmentation communication etc.</li>
  <li>Autonomous (GNSS/CN-based) EFC</li>
  <li>ANPR-based (aka ALPR) EFC and end-user compliance
  checking</li>
  <li>information flows between EFC operators (back-office
  communication between toll chargers and toll service
  providers)</li>
  <li>performance indicators - metrics and examination
  framework</li>
  <li>system and application interface conformity-related
  assessment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>WG 5 also:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>reviews interference studies and investigates interferences
  of other wireless communication media to DSRC, either on its own
  or in collaboration with other WGs/Standardization bodies,</li>
  <li>reviews, investigates and elaborates standard documents for
  road transport-related payment means and services (e.g. user
  identification and payment means based using integrated
  circuit(s) cards, common transport payment means, EFC as an
  instrument to support traffic management). This is also performed
  in collaboration, interaction or support to other
  WGs/standardization bodies.</li>
