<p>ISO / TC 204 standardizes all aspects of information and communication technologies (ICT) for the control, operations and management of surface and near-surface transport systems. It is responsible for the overall system and infrastructure aspects of intelligent transport systems (ITS), as well as the coordination of the overall ISO work programme in this field. This scope covers pedestrians as well as private, public, and commercial movement of people and goods using roads, bridges, tunnels, ferries, motorways, micromobility, public-area mobile robots (PMRs), low-flying aerial vehicles, motorized and non-motorized vehicles, and various driving automation systems within indoor, outdoor, urban, rural, intermodal, and multimodal environments.</p>

<p>The scope includes, but is not limited to, the following service domains and technical aspects as formally defined by ISO 14813-1: traveller information, traffic management and operations, vehicle services, freight transport, public transport, emergency service, payment for transport-related services, weather and environmental conditions monitoring, disaster response management and coordination, performance management.</p>

<p>Excluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-vehicle information and control systems that use only on-board information without relying on exteroceptive sensing or external communications, and that do not generate warnings or vehicle control (ISO/TC 22, ISO/TC 149)</li>
<li>Off-road operations of select vehicle types (ISO/TC 8, ISO/TC 20, ISO/TC 23, ISO/TC 127, ISO/TC 269, ISO/TC 299)</li>
</ul>
