  <p>The purpose of WG 18 is to develop standards that facilitate
  the sharing of data among multiple, potentially unknown ITS
  applications to better meet user needs and to create an ecosystem
  of information known as cooperative ITS (C-ITS). Many of the work
  items within this working group are coordinated with CEN/TC
  278/WG 16.</p>
  <p>WG18 activities include standardization in the fields of:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Local Dynamic Maps (LDM);</li>
  <li>In vehicle signage (displaying road traffic
  information);</li>
  <li>V2I / I2V communication for signalized intersections (SPaT,
  MAP, SRM and SSM);</li>
  <li>Message structure definitions for exchanging In-vehicle
  information (IVI)&nbsp;;</li>
  <li>Security in the field of communication between
  C-ITS-Stations;</li>
  <li>Communication profiles for secure connection between ITS
  stations and vehicles</li>
  <li>Integrated security for AVPS;</li>
  <li>Data dictionary of vehicle-based information for C-ITS
  applications (Global transport data management, GTDM);</li>
  <li>(Gap) Analysis of road operator viewpoints in their role of
  C-ITS users and developers.</li>
  <li>PKI infrastructure ITS station security services for secure
  session establishment and authentication between trusted
  devices</li>
  </ul>
