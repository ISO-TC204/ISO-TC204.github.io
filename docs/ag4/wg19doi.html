  <p>The purpose of WG19 is to act as a facilitator for mobility
  standards development and to harmonize and form consensus for
  mobility standards. WG 19 provides cross-pollination among
  other ITS standards groups (e.g., across ISO/TC 204 working
  groups and with relevant groups within CEN, ETSI, SAE, etc.)</p>
  <p>WG19 activities include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Specific mobility integration needs in urban and rural areas,
  including concepts such as smart cities,</li>
  <li>Parking and parking integration,</li>
  <li>Standardisation supporting the public sector (and other)
  regulation information sharing needs such as electronic traffic
  regulations (METR) and controlled zones,</li>
  <li>Harmonization of terminology and related architectural
  aspects that involves mobility issues benefitting from
  integration across transport sectors in coordination with
  WG1</li>
  <li>Governance support for ITS operations,</li>
  <li>Automation integration in the overall transport chain,
  ranging from micromobility in urban areas, such as public-area
  mobile robots to coordination of automated road vehicles,
  and</li>
  <li>Mobility aspects that are cross-cutting and not covered by
  any single WG in the ITS domain.</li>
