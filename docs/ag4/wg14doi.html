  <p>The purpose of WG 14 is to standardize general system aspects
  of driving automation systems (i.e. Level 1 through 5) and active
  safety systems utilizing external sensing (e.g. collision warning
  and control assistance systems).</p>
  <p>WG14 activities include standardizing:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Functional requirements, performance requirements, system
  specifications and basic test procedures to verify that the
  functional / performance requirements have been met</li>
  <li>Vehicle behaviour (vehicle control responses) based on
  information about conditions external to the vehicle (i.e, from
  onboard sensor data perceiving conditions outside the vehicle,
  information received via communications with external
  sources)</li>
  <li>Integration of information collected from infrastructure-based devices,
  roadway maps and real-time data, into driving automation and active safety
  systems</li>
  <li>Cooperative operational coordination among vehicles and
  between vehicles and the infrastructure</li>
  <li>Functionalities related to improving safety, sustainability,
  interoperability, efficiency, driving comfort and
  convenience</li>
  <li>Terminology and framework</li>
  </ul>
