# Registries managed by ISO TC 204

ISO TC 204 manages registries to maintain information that needs to be updated more frequently than the normal standards update cycle, including the following:

??? info "Registry for ITS Identifiers (RITSI)"
    [Registry for ITS Identifiers (RITSI)](ritsi/): This registry records assigned values used for various identifier types (e.g., the ITS application identifier (ITS-AID)). The listing of ITS-AID values is identical to and is coordinated with the [listing of Provider Service Identifiers (PSIDs)](https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/psid/public/) as managed by IEEE.

??? "Registry for ITS Ontologies (RITSO)"
    [Registry for ITS Ontologies (RITSO)](ritso/index.md): This registry, which is still under initial stages of development, records the ontology (sometimes called the data model), for ITS and define how key ITS concepts relate to each other.

??? info "EN ISO 14816 Register"
    The [EN ISO 14816 Register](https://www.itsstandards.eu/registries/) is the official information page of the Central Registration Authority for **_EN ISO 14816 Road transport and traffic telematics - Automatic vehicle and equipment identification - Numbering and data structures_**. The site is developed and maintained by [CEN/TC278 Intelligent Transport Systems](https://www.cencenelec.eu/areas-of-work/cen-sectors/transport-and-packaging-cen/intelligent-transport-systems/).
