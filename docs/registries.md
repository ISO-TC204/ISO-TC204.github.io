# Registries managed by ISO TC 204

ISO TC 204 manages registries to maintain information that needs to be updated more frequently than the normal standards update cycle, including the following:

- [Registry for ITS Identifiers (RITSI)](https://iso-tc204.github.io/iso5345/): This registry records assigned values used for various identifier types (e.g., the ITS application identifier (ITS-AID)).
- [Registry for ITS Ontologies (RITSO)](https://k-vaughn.github.io/ontologies/latest/): This registry, which is still under initial stages of development, records the ontology (sometimes called the data model), for ITS and define how key ITS concepts relate to each other.
