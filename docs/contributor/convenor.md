### Naming Convention for TC204 Deliverables 
Our document titles may seem a little daunting, however they typically use the multi-level naming structure:
<kbd> <Publishing SDO(s)> /  Type of Deliverable <Number[-Part]>: Year of Publication (language) <Title 1> - <Title 2> [ - <Title 3>]</kbd>
 
The example below is described more fully in the following table:
<kbd>ISO/TS 14813-1:2015(en) Intelligent transport systems â€” Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector - Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services</kdb>
 
> ðŸš§ Need to resolve the table formatting below

|Name Component|Example|Description|
|<Publishing SDO/s>|**ISO**|The Standards Development Organisation/s (SDO) that will publish the deliverable|
|<Deliverable Type> |**TS**|The [types of ISO deliverables](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm)|
|<Number[-Part]>|**14813-1**|Unique identifier of the deliverable, which can include an optional *Part* number to indicate they are focussed components detailing a specific aspect. This can also facilitate progressive development and publishing and use of a suite of documents over time.|
|<Year of Publication>|**2015**|Year that the deliverable is formally published and released for use by ISO|
|<language>|**(en)**|Used to distinguish between **en** (English) and **fr** *(*French) editions of a document|
|<Title 1>|**Intelligent transport systems** |Most of our deliverables now use the name of TC204 for the top tier <Title 1>|
|<Title 2>|**Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector**|Key concept|
|<Title 3>|**Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services**|The <Title 3> level is optional, but is frequently used in order to describe specific aspects of the Key concept. Note that â€œPart 1: â€œ is considered part of the title|
