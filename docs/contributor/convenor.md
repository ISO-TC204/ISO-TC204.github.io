### Naming Convention for TC204 Deliverables 

Our document titles may seem a little daunting, however they typically use the multi-level naming structure:

`<Publishing SDO(s)>`/`<Deliverable Type>` `<Number[-Part]>`:`<Year of Publication>`[(`<language>`)] `<Title 1>` - `<Title 2>` [ - `<Title 3>`]

!!! example
    ISO/TS 14813-1:2015(en) Intelligent transport systems â€” Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector - Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services
 
|Name Component      |Example|Description|
|:------------------:|:-----:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|Publishing SDO(s)   |ISO    |The Standards Development Organisation(s) that will publish the deliverable      |
|Deliverable Type    |TS     |The [type of deliverable](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm)                                                                                          |
|Number[-Part]       |14813-1|Unique identifier of the deliverable, which can include an optional *Part* number to indicate they are focussed components detailing a specific aspect. This can also facilitate progressive development and publishing and use of a suite of documents over time.                                                      |
|Year of Publication |2015   |Year that the deliverable is formally published and released for use             |
|language            |en     |Used to distinguish between English and French editions of a document            |
|Title 1  |Intelligent transport systems |Used for most TC204 deliverables                                     |
|Title 2> |Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector|Key concept                                      |
|Title 3  |Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services|An optional component, but frequently used in order to describe specific aspects of the Key concept. Note that â€œPart 1: â€œ is considered part of the title    |

## Resolution Templates

Many resolutions within ISO/TC 204 are proposed by WG convenors in order to launch, advance, or maintain ISO standards. The following examples provide templates for preparing these resolutions and provides guidance on when resolutions are needed versus merely providing status updates to the plenary.

!!! note
    In the following examples, the tables may list multiple documents as a part of a single resolution. When this occurs, the resolution should ensure that any supplemental information (e.g., timeframe) is properly shown for each document.

!!! example "New preliminary work item"
    ISO/TC 204 resolves to create the following Preliminary Work Item:

    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

    !!! note
        The document number is left blank if it is unknown (e.g., a new work item that is not part of an existing series). The resolution may request a number in such instances.

!!! example "New work item and NP ballot"
    ISO/TC 204 resolves to create the following Work Item and send it to NP ballot:

    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

    !!! note
        The document number is left blank if it is unknown (e.g., a new work item that is not part of an existing series). The resolution may request a number in such instances.

!!! example "NP ballot for existing PWI"
    ISO/TC 204 resolves to send the following Preliminary Work Item to NP ballot:

    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

!!! example "Withdraw an existing PWI"
    ISO/TC 204 resolves to delete the following Preliminary Work Item:

    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

!!! example "Start an amendment to a published document"
    [ISO/TC 204 notes: `<any justification>`]

    ISO/TC 204 resolves to create an amendment fpr the following document:
    
    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

    Whilst noting the following elements:

    - [`<development will be made under Vienna Agreement with ISO lead>`]
    - [`<registration stage: e.g., 20.00>`]
    - Timeframe: `<timeframe>`
    - Project leader: `<project leader>` (`<member body>`)

!!! example "Start an update to a published document"
    [ISO/TC 204 notes: `<any of the following or similar justification>`

    - the result of the systematic review of `<document number>` (cf. N `<N number of the results document>`)
    - the recommendation of its WG `<WG number>` to revise `<document number>`
    - the recommendation of its WG `<WG number>` to convert `<document number>` to an IS]

    ISO/TC 204 resolves to revise the following document:
    
    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    | `<document number>` | `<document title>` |

    Whilst noting the following elements:

    - `<conformation/revision>` of the title
    - `<conformation/revision>` of the scope
    - [`<development will be made under Vienna Agreement with ISO lead>`]
    - [`<registration at stage e.g., 20.00>`]
    - Timeframe: `<timeframe>`
    - Project leader: `<project leader>` (`<member body>`)

!!! example "Reaffirm a published document"
    ISO/TC 204 notes:

    - the result of the systematic review of `<document number>` (cf. N `<N number of the results document>`)

    ISO/TC 204 resolves to confirm the following document:
    
    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|

    | Ref                 | Title              |
    |---------------------|--------------------|

## Other resolutions

!!! example "Establish a liaison officer"
    ISO/TC 204 resolves to appoint `<liaison officer>` (`<member body>`) as its liaison officer to `<liaison group number>` `<liaison group title>`.
