# Welcome TC204 and Collaborating Editors!

Our colleagues in TC211 have developed a [Good Practices for Standards Development](https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/resolutions/isotc-211-good-practices.html) to give accessible and relevant guidance on how to take part in developing standards in ISO/TC 211. But it seems like a great start for TC204 editors!
