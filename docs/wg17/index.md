### Overview <!-- Optional -->
<!-- On a new line below, provide an overview of the subject area for the associated group of standards. -->
The ISO 17739 standard series are related to improve the road safety among connected automated mobility including vulnerable road users (VRUs), connected vehicle, non-connected vehicle that have nomadic device on their hand or on top of the vehicle.

**Abstract:** This document specifies general information and use-cases to provide the road safety enhancement services by sharing status and/or intent messages on nomadic devices between vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles including non-automated vehicle, automated vehicle and connected vehicle to be applicable in the specific urban localized area such as un-signalized intersection, T-intersection, roundabout, low speed zone, school zone, weaving area, and etc.

### Description

This document contains a set of safety
enhancement use cases focusing on VRUs with nomadic device on their hand as well as on-board unit on the urban connected automated mobility that provides connectivity with nomadic device. In addition, this document also delivers related standards required to provide the road safety support service to VRUs and vehicles including urban connected automated mobility, and non-automated mobility with intelligent transport systems (ITS) technologies.

**Abstract:** Based on the use cases in ISO 17739-1, this standard specifies common messages and its data structure that is essential to implement the use cases defined in ISO 17739-1.

### Description

The messages and its data structure refer to existing standardized V2X messages in SAE and ETSI ITS by gap analysis. This standard defines new messages and its data structure in case there is not appropriate message in existing standardized V2X message.
