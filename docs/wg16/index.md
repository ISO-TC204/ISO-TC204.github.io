    **Abstract:** This document defines requirements for ITS station units.
    
    **Description:**
    
   <!-- The current edition focuses on the cybersecurity requirements within each bounded security managed entity (BSME) within the ITS-SU and includes other related requirements as needed.  
    
    A BSME includes an instantiation of an ITS station (ITS-S), which includes a subnetwork layer, a networking and transport layer, a facilities layer, a management entity, a security entity, and optionally an ITS applications entity per the ITS station reference architecture (ISO 21217) and represents an ITS-S node (ISO 21217:2020, §3.47).
