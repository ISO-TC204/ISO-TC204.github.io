## Graphic Data Dictionary (ISO 14823)

The graphic data dictionary defines how to concisely convey traffic sign information in a language-independent format. All internationally-recognized symbols for road signs are assigned a unique identifier that allows local customization and extension as needed. In addition, additional information (e.g., time of validity) can also be provided to supplement the main sign.

## Transport Protocols Expert Group (I and II)

In cooperation with the Traveller Information Services Association ([TISA](https://tisa.org)), ISO TC 204 WG10 develops and maintains the TPEG (ISO 18234) and TPEG II (ISO 21219) standard series, which define how to exchange traffic and travel information over various media.
