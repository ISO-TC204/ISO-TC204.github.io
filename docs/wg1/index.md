# Architecture (ISO TC 204 WG 1)

## Domain of interest

The purpose of WG1 is to promote consistency across ISO/TC 204 standards by
encouraging adherence to a consistent ITS architecture (including consistent
user services and data concepts) and documentation approach (including
consistent technical approaches, documentation formats, and terminology)
across working groups.

WG1 activities include:

- Defining [shared terminology](#vocabulary) to be used throughout ISO/TC 204 standards
- Promoting a common [ITS reference architecture](#reference-its-architecture)
for ITS services across WGs by working with regional ITS architecture efforts
- Identifying gaps and overlaps within the architecture for ITS services to be
addressed through standards
- Promoting common methods for documenting ISO/TC 204 standards and data concepts
- Investigating how to develop a common data model across ITS
- Providing guidance on the application of ICT-related technologies within ITS

## News and highlights

Edition 2 of ISO/TS 14812 (ITS Vocabulary) is expected to be approved in 2025.
The new version adds definitions for:

- information security terms (e.g., authentication)
- concept realization terms (e.g., implementation)
- device component terms (e.g., sensor)
- additional alternate mode terms (e.g., shared-space)
- additional road network terms (e.g., alley)
- facility terms (e.g., bridge)
- kerbside usage terms (e.g., loading area)
- road equipment terms (e.g., traffic control device)
- additional location terms (e.g., geographic feature)
- jurisdictional terms (e.g., campus)
- additional traveller terms (e.g., vulnerable road user)
- additional vehicle attribute terms (e.g., vehicle fuel type)
- financial terms (e.g., payment mode)

## Reference ITS architecture

??? note "[ISO 14813-1:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/85840.html)"

    **Title:** Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s)
    for the ITS sector — Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services

    **Status:** Approved

    **Abstract:** This document provides a description of the primary services
    that have been internationally defined to promote consistency among
    implementations. Implementations can provide any of these services in
    combination with any other services that are appropriate. This document
    organizes ITS services by defining service groups, which are placed into
    one of several service domains. Each service group contains one or more
    individual services, each of which is described.

    ### Description

    This document is intended for use by at least two groups of people involved
    in the ITS sector:

    - those who are looking for ideas about the services that ITS
    implementations can provide, and
    - those who are developing International Standards.

    For the first group, this document provides service descriptions that can
    act as the catalyst for more detailed descriptions. The level of detail can
    differ from one ITS implementation to another, depending on whether or not
    a national ITS architecture is involved, and whether or not this
    architecture is based directly on services, or on groups of functions. The
    service descriptions in this document are pitched at a high-level as too
    much detail can be prescriptive and reduces flexibility.

    For standards developers, this document is applicable to Technical
    Committees who are developing International Standards for the ITS sector.
    This document is designed to provide information and explanations of
    services that can form the basis and reason for developing standards.

    Due to its nature, this document is largely advisory and informative with
    minimal requirements. It is designed to assist the integration of services
    into a cohesive reference architecture, thereby promoting interoperability
    and the use of common data definitions. Specifically, services defined within
    the service groups can be the basis for defining “use cases”, “user needs”
    or "user service requirements” depending on the methodology being used to
    develop the resultant ITS architecture functionality. They can also assist
    with defining applicable data within data dictionaries, and applicable
    communications and data exchange standards.

    **Title:** Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s)
    for the ITS sector — Part 5: Requirements for architecture description in
    ITS standards

    **Status:** Approved

    **Abstract:** This document defines documentation rules for standards that
    define interfaces between or among system elements of an ITS reference
    architecture. This includes:

    1. requirements for documenting aspects of the ITS reference architecture;
    2. terminology to be used when documenting or referencing aspects of the
    ITS reference architecture.

    **Title:** Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s)
    for the ITS sector — Part 6: Use of ASN.1

    **Status:** Approved

    **Abstract:** provides a formal means to achieve consistency in the use of
    ASN.1 when specifying data types that are to be used in ITS International
    Standards. This is designed to ensure unambiguous and interoperable data
    exchange while providing consistent documentation of these exchanges. This
    document provides the necessary specifications to ensure consistent
    interpretation by providing formal references to several standards and in
    some cases specifying additional rules to promote greater consistency among
    standards.
