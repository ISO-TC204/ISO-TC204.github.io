# **EU CCMS Security Policy**

The European Cooperative Credential Management System (CCMS) provides the trust management framework for C-ITS communications across the EU. The CCMS Security Policy establishes:

- Certificate lifecycle governance for issuing, managing, and revoking ITS device certificates, including Authorization Tickets (ATs) and Enrollment Credentials (ECs) that ensure message authenticity and system-wide trust.
- European Certificate Trust List (ECTL) management through the Trust List Manager (TLM), which maintains centralized trust anchors and defines which Certificate Authorities are authorized to participate in the EU C-ITS ecosystem.
- Privacy protection and pseudonymity enforcement requiring that routine V2X messages use short-lived pseudonym certificates rather than long-term identity credentials, preventing vehicle tracking while maintaining security.
- Operational policies and procedures governing certificate validation, misbehavior reporting, and incident response across all participating EU member states and stakeholders.

The CCMS Security Policy ensures interoperability and consistent security standards across European C-ITS deployments while supporting cross-border certificate recognition and trust relationships.
