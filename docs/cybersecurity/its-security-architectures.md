# ITS Security Architectures

The security of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) relies on robust and adaptable architectures designed to meet global, regional, and application-specific needs. As ITS systems continue to evolve, so too must the cybersecurity frameworks that protect them. This section introduces the concept of ITS security architectures and explores key components such as layers of security, end-to-end secure communication, and regional considerations.

## Subsections of ITS Security Architectures

### 1. [Layers of Security](layers-of-security.md)
Securing ITS systems requires a multi-layered approach that protects various components, including:

- **Transmissions**: Ensuring secure communication over wireless and wired networks.
- **Messages**: Guaranteeing message authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.
- **Applications**: Protecting ITS applications from unauthorized access or manipulation.
- **Devices**: Safeguarding the physical and digital security of devices such as OBUs, RSUs, and ECUs.

### 2. [End-to-End Security](end-to-end-security.md)
ITS environments demand end-to-end security to maintain trust throughout the lifecycle of a message or data exchange. This involves:

- **Secure Messaging**: From the producer (e.g., a vehicle or infrastructure device) to the consumer (e.g., another vehicle or a traffic management system).
- **Trust Bridges**: Used to extend trust across multiple domains or jurisdictions while preserving message integrity and authenticity.

### 3. [Regional Considerations](regional-considerations.md)
Regional differences significantly impact ITS cybersecurity architectures. For example:

- **United States**: Primarily uses the SCMS for V2X communications, emphasizing privacy through pseudonym certificates and efficient certificate management.
- **Europe**: Employs the CCMS.

## Cybersecurity Frameworks

ITS cybersecurity frameworks must operate at a global scale, accommodating the unique requirements of diverse stakeholders, including governments, manufacturers, and service providers. The following global architectures play a pivotal role in securing ITS:

- **Security Credential Management System (SCMS)**: Designed to support Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, SCMS manages certificate issuance, revocation, and lifecycle for secure messaging between vehicles, infrastructure, and other ITS entities.
- **Cooperative ITS Credential Management System (CCMS)**: Similar to SCMS but tailored to regional Cooperative ITS deployments, such as those in Europe.
