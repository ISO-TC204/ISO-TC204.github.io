# Secure Manufacturing and Development (D) Patterns

## Pattern D1: Vulnerability Management Program

Establishes a structured, repeatable process for identifying, classifying, and remediating vulnerabilities in ITS applications and systems. This pattern ensures developers and maintainers implement a documented vulnerability management program that includes scanning, triage, patching, secure communications with researchers, and user notification.

### Implementation Context

This pattern applies to any organization that develops or maintains ITS applications, onboard systems (OBUs), infrastructure software (e.g., RSUs), or backend services. Vulnerability management is critical to reduce exploitable attack surfaces, meet regulatory expectations, and demonstrate due diligence.

| **Applies To**   | Application Developers, OEMs, System Integrators, Backend Service Providers |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Used For**     | Vulnerability scanning, verification, patching, and disclosure |
| **Dependencies** | SBOMs, secure update mechanism, vulnerability tracking and classification tools, contact management |

### Key Components

| Component                    | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vulnerability Scanning Tools | Perform regular scans on OS, libraries, web services, and firmware. |
| Triage and Classification    | Verify vulnerabilities and assign risk categories (e.g., critical, high). |
| Contact Point for Reporting  | Designated researcher and customer contact (e.g., security@domain.com). |
| Patch Management Process     | Defines procedures for applying and testing security patches. |
| End-User Notification        | Formal method for informing users when patches are available. |
| Remediation Timelines        | Defines maximum time allowed based on severity class.        |
| Security Patch Verification  | Ensures vulnerability is fully remediated and patch integrity is validated. |

### Implementation Details

- Scanning & Detection: Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the development lifecycle. Scan third-party libraries, firmware components, and platform dependencies as part of build or pre-release processes. Schedule full system scans (static/dynamic) prior to major releases.
- Verification & Classification: Review each vulnerability for its potential to be exploited in the deployed environment. Categorize findings using industry standard metrics (e.g., CVSS). Distinguish false positives, document conditions for exploit, and flag high-risk vectors for immediate action.
- Contact Point for Disclosure: Provide a security contact (e.g., `security@yourdomain.com`) and response policy. Monitor submissions from researchers or users and acknowledge reports within a defined SLA. Track inbound reports through a structured intake workflow.
- Remediation Planning: Assign verified vulnerabilities to development teams for remediation. Define a severity-based patch timeline (e.g., critical: 7 days; high: 30 days). Use version control tagging and commit-level traceability for all fixes.
- Patch Testing & Release: Build and test security patches using defined QA workflows. Include regression testing, backward compatibility checks, and validation of the fix. Use digitally signed binaries and validated update packages for delivery.
- User Notification & Disclosure: When a vulnerability fix is deployed, publish release notes with a CVE or internal identifier, affected versions, and remediation instructions. Coordinate responsible disclosure with affected partners or integrators.
- Audit & Traceability: Maintain a log of all vulnerability reports, resolution actions, test outcomes, patch deployments, and communications. Ensure traceability between discovery, fix, and disclosure. Use this log for internal audits or third-party assessments.

### Example Use Cases

| Scenario                    | Behaviour Enforced                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Researcher Disclosure       | A third-party security researcher identifies a buffer overflow in an RSU API and emails the listed security contact. A ticket is opened, the vulnerability is verified, and a patch is scheduled. |
| CVE Scan in Web Application | A scanner detects outdated TLS libraries in a traffic app backend. Triage confirms risk, updates the library, and informs customers. |

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Used For**     | Secure development of OBUs, RSUs, backend services, and V2X applications |
| **Dependencies** | Developer training, secure coding standards, testing frameworks, version control policies |

### Key Components

| **Component**                | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Secure Development Lifecycle | A formalized development process that includes security checkpoints at each phase |
| Threat Modelling              | Identify potential attack vectors, misuse cases, and trust boundaries early in design |
| Static/Dynamic/Fuzz Testing  | Use automated tools to uncover vulnerabilities in source code and runtime behaviour |
| Secure Coding Standards      | Apply consistent rules (e.g., MISRA, SEI CERT) to prevent implementation-level flaws |
| Quality Control System       | Track defect rates, code quality metrics, and security regression results through CI/CD |
| Developer Training           | Ensure engineers understand secure development principles and product-specific risks |

### Implementation Details

- Requirements & Design: Begin by performing a security-focused review of product architecture. Identify trust boundaries, data sensitivity, and critical services. Develop threat models to anticipate misuse or compromise scenarios. Apply architectural controls early (e.g., privilege separation, secure boot).
- Coding & Build Phase: Enforce secure coding standards and require code reviews with security checklists. Integrate static analysis tools and dynamic analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Use fuzz testing for inputs like V2X messages, web APIs, or firmware update channels.
- Test & Validation: Perform security regression testing, including authentication/authorization tests, input validation, and transport security checks. Integrate third-party security testing tools and validate security functions (e.g., certificate validation logic, logging, and error handling).
- Quality Control: Maintain centralized tracking of test coverage, open vulnerabilities, patch backlog, and known defects. All releases must pass quality gates including functional correctness, performance, and cybersecurity posture.
- Release & Deployment: Digitally sign release artifacts and maintain integrity verification workflows. Validate that installation or update procedures include checks for compatibility, authentication, and rollback safety.
- Maintenance & Support: Track reported vulnerabilities through a vulnerability management program. Reassess threats periodically and update the SDL based on evolving threat landscape or standards updates.

### Example Use Cases

| **Scenario**             | **Behaviour Enforced**                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RSU Firmware Development | A vendor implements a secure firmware update flow and tracks defects through a secure CI/CD pipeline. |
| V2X Application Rollout  | A fleet management app is built using SDL. Threat modelling identifies risk of spoofed messages; mitigation is added, and regression tests validate correctness. |

| SBOM Format Specification | Use standard formats such as SPDX, CycloneDX, or SWID to ensure consistency and automation. |
| Component Inventory       | A complete list of software components (name, version, vendor, license, hash). |
| Dependency Mapping        | Include relationships between software components (parent-child, static/dynamic linking). |
| Vulnerability References  | Link components to known vulnerabilities via CVE or CPE identifiers where possible. |
| Update and Maintenance    | Define how and when the SBOM is updated (e.g., on each software release or patch cycle). |

### Implementation Details

- Tool Integration: Use automated tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines to generate SBOMs during the build process. Validate that the SBOM reflects the final deployed image or firmware.
- Format Selection: Choose a recognized standard such as SPDX  or CycloneDX , and ensure output is machine-readable (e.g., JSON or XML).
- Component Granularity: List all software packages and libraries, including open-source, proprietary, and third-party components.
- Validation and Review: Perform SBOM validation to check for completeness, accuracy, and alignment with product binaries.
