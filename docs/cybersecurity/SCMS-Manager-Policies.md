**US SCMS Manager Policy**

The Security Credential Management System (SCMS) Manager Policy governs the foundational trust infrastructure for V2X communications in North America. The policy framework establishes:

- PKI governance and operational structure defining roles and responsibilities for Root CAs, Pseudonym CAs, Enrollment CAs, Registration Authorities, and Misbehavior Authorities within the SCMS ecosystem.
- Device eligibility and credential management ensuring only compliant devices receive certificates, with ongoing support for pseudonym certificate rotation, misbehavior detection, and certificate revocation through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
- Privacy-by-design architecture protecting end-user privacy through certificate revocation, location obscuring proxies, and distributed authority functions that prevent single-point tracking or compromise.
- Security and trust anchor management providing core policy foundations, governance oversight, and coordination among various SCMS components and stakeholders, including state/local transportation organizations and industry partners.

The SCMS Manager Policy ensures scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving V2X communications for the anticipated deployment of over 300 million connected vehicles in the US market.
