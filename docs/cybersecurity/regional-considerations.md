# Regional Considerations in ITS Security Architectures

ITS security architectures must account for regional variations in standards, technologies, and deployment strategies.

## North America

### Security Credential Management System (SCMS)
In North America, the SCMS serves provide credential services. It is designed to manage certificates for secure, privacy-preserving communication to vehicles and ITS equipment. 

#### Key Features of SCMS:
- **Pseudonym Certificates**: Provides anonymity for vehicles while ensuring message authenticity.
- **Certificate Revocation**: Mechanisms for identifying and disabling compromised entities.
- **Scalability**: Supports the high volume of certificates required for millions of vehicles and devices.

## Europe

### Cooperative ITS Credential Management System (CCMS)
Europe employs the Cooperative ITS Credential Management System (CCMS) as its credential management system, in contrast to the SCMS. The CCMS is tailored to the European Union's regulatory and operational environment. 

#### Key Features of CCMS:
- **Centralized Architecture**: A more hierarchical structure compared to the SCMS.
- **ETSI Standards**: Aligns with ETSI TS 103 097 for security headers and certificate management.
- **Privacy and Anonymity**: Uses pseudonym certificates to protect user identity.

#### Deployment Context:
- CCMS integrates with **ETSI C-ITS standards**, ensuring interoperability across member states.
- It supports cross-border communication, a critical need in Europe due to the proximity of neighboring countries and high levels of cross-border travel.
