## **Stakeholder Groups and Their Cybersecurity Focus Areas**

To build and maintain a secure and trusted ITS ecosystem, every stakeholder must work in a coordination with other stakeholders. This page helps different stakeholder groups understand the specific responsibilities they hold and how their decisions impact system-wide trust, safety, and interoperability.

The diagram below illustrates the relationship between international standards, national/regional policies, and deployment-level implementations. This layered model is not just informative—it reflects your real-world responsibility as a contributor to secure transportation.

### Use This Page to Guide Your Action

- **If you're a [standards developer](standards-developers.md)**, focus on ensuring cryptographic interoperability, aligning with evolving threat models, and updating certificate formats and trust frameworks for global coordination.
- **If you're a [policy maker](policy-makers.md)**, prioritize mandates that enforce consistent use of proven standards, require conformance to trust frameworks, and define governance models that support long-term certificate and key lifecycle management.
- **If you're an [implementer](implementers.md)**, ensure your systems and devices enforce trust boundaries, install appropriate credentials, and detect and react to misbehaviour. Make sure your deployments conform to architecture-layer expectations and your vendors meet lifecycle and revocation requirements.

Each stakeholder’s actions directly influence the cybersecurity maturity of the ecosystem. While the pages above are tailored to each group, effective ITS cybersecurity requires shared responsibility. Stakeholders must align on architecture, policies, and operational practices to ensure safety, privacy, and trust at every level of the transportation system.
