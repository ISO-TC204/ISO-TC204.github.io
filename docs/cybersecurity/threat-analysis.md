# Performing an ITS Threat Analysis

ITS operators should conduct threat analysis by evaluating how adversaries could compromise specific functions across the system. Begin by identifying each system component and  for each, assess the types of data it handles, the services it provides, and the interfaces it exposes. Use that information to define the threat surface and determine which attack scenarios are most relevant. Map each identified threat to an [ITS Cybersecurity Pattern](its-security-patterns.md). As the system evolves, repeat the threat analysis to validate that protections remain effective and aligned to real-world risks.

## High-Level Process for Conducting an ITS Threat Analysis

While specific methodologies may vary, most ITS threat analysis efforts follow a common structure. The following high-level steps apply broadly across both European and North American contexts:

1. **Define Scope and Boundaries**
    Identify which ITS devices are within scope for the threat analysis. This should include field devices, communications links, backend systems, cloud applications applications, etc). Document external interfaces.
2. **Identify Assets, Data Flows and Security Objectives** Determine what needs protection within the system. This would include for example cryptographic keys, GNSS data, video feeds, V2X messages, etc. For each asset, define the associated data flows to other assets and for each data flow define security objectives such as ensuring integrity, availability, confidentiality, or non-repudiation.
3. **Identify Threats**  Once assets and data flows are known, consider how they could be targeted. Threats may include unauthorized access, spoofing, message manipulation, denial-of-service, physical tampering, among others. Leverage tools such as the MITRE ATT&CK Framework for a better understanding of attack types, and understand that attacks are often strung together in order to achieve greater effect.  
4. **Evaluate Risk**:  Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each threat materializing, taking into account the environment in which the system operates. This assessment may be qualitative or quantitative. It helps prioritize which risks require mitigation and which may be accepted based on  operational context.
5. **Select and Align Controls**:  For threats requiring mitigation, identify suitable security controls which may be technical, procedural, or administrative. These may include for example message authentication, physical protections, redundancy, or personnel training. Control selection should reflect both the risk profile and the systemâ€™s functional requirements. Review the [ITS Cybersecurity Patterns](its-security-patterns.md) page for more information on possible control selection.
6. **Document and Reassess**:  Maintain records of the analysis, including identified threats, rationale for control selection, and residual risks. Threat analysis should be revisited periodically or when significant changes are made to system architecture, configuration, or usage patterns.

### European Threat Analysis Guidance

In European Cooperative ITS deployments, threat analysis practices are well-established through a combination of technical reports and policy mandates:

- ETSI TR 102 893 outlines a Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Analysis (TVRA) methodology tailored to ITS environments. It provides a structured approach for identifying assets, categorizing threats, and evaluating risk based on likelihood and impact.
- The CCMS Security Policy requires station operators and manufacturers to conduct and maintain operational risk analyses. These are typically carried out using ISO/IEC 27005, which offers a repeatable process for risk management and ties directly to broader information security standards.

### North American Threat Analysis Guidance

In North America, threat analysis activities are often embedded within more general cybersecurity and risk management frameworks:

- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is widely adopted across critical infrastructure sectors, including transportation. It provides a functional model for cybersecurity organized around the lifecycle of identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.
- The ITS Cybersecurity Profile adapts the NIST CSF for transportation environments, offering detailed guidance tailored to ITS deployments. It outlines cybersecurity activities for stakeholders managing devices like Dynamic Message Signs, Closed-Circuit Television cameras, and Roadside Units.
- Additional resources from the U.S. Department of Transportation, including procedural guidance and control set templates, support risk-informed decision-making for public agencies and infrastructure operators.

## ITS Threat Catalogue

The following threats may be applicable to an ITS. You may use these threats as references when developing your system-specific threat analysis and risk profile. See the Recommended Cybersecurity Controls column to identify controls that can be used to mitigate these threats in part or in whole.
