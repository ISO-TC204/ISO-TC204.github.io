# Introduction to ITS Cybersecurity Guidance

Welcome. This resource serves as a guide to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) cybersecurity. It outlines the importance of ITS-tailored security mechanisms, the role of cybersecurity standards, and recommendations for selecting optimal cybersecurity standards for ITS implementations.

## Start Here: [Introduction to ITS Cybersecurity â€“ A Beginner's Guide](dummys-guide.md)
Start with this introductory guide to understand why custom ITS security mechanisms, such as IEEE 1609.2, are essential, and why traditional security frameworks like X.509 are often insufficient for ITS and V2X systems.

## Key Topics in ITS Cybersecurity

### 1. [ITS Security Architectures](its-security-architectures.md)
ITS cybersecurity architectures include the systems and processes used to secure devices, vehicles, communications networks, and backend systems. This section describes how these components interact to ensure secure data exchanges, establish trust between entities, and support interoperability across regions and jurisdictions.

### 2. [Security Standards and Their Roles](security-standards.md)
This section explains key international standards for ITS security, including ISO 21177, IEEE 1609.2, and European standards such as ETSI TS 102 940 and ETSI TS 103 097. It describes the contexts in which these standards apply and provides guidance on selecting the right standard for specific ITS applications.

### 3. [Trust Bridges](trust-bridges.md)
Trust bridges are mechanisms that enable the secure sharing of information between two independent domains. They can allow sharing of information between domains that may operate under differing security and operating policies and may also support bridging between domains that use different cybersecurity frameworks, such as X.509 and IEEE 1609.2. 

### 4. [Cybersecurity Systems and Components](system-specific-security.md)
Cybersecurity systems and components provide the building blocks that can be used to create a cybersecurity architecture for individual ITS systems. These systems and components include mechanisms for secure messaging, managing certificates, managing entitlements, identifying and responding to misbehaviors and threats, as well as  measures to protect specific ITS devices such as Onboard Units (OBUs), Roadside Units (RSUs), and backend infrastructure services.

### 5. [Stakeholder-Specific Guidance](stakeholder-guidance.md)
This section provides guidance tailored to different stakeholder perspectives, helping decision-makers, standards developers, and implementers identify policies, standards, and practices to secure ITS deployments. Guidance is included for: 

- **Decision-makers** who may focus on defining and monitoring progress against strategic objectives. 
- **Standards developers** who need to ensure alignment with international standards to ensure interoperability. 
- **Implementers** who need to address practical challenges and considerations during deployment. 

### 6. [Security Policies and Governance](security-policies.md)
This section discusses ITS security policies and governance frameworks that support device cybersecurity lifecycle management. This includes for example, certificate enrollment and management, cross-jurisdictional interoperability, compliance with privacy regulations, and alignment with regional, national and international standards. 

### 7. [Specialized Use Cases](specialized-use-cases.md)
This section provides use case examples of cybersecurity applied to specific scenarios. For example, how cybersecurity applies to specific systems (e.g., cooperative driving automation (CDA), mobile edge computing (MEC), as well as specific message types such as Traveller Information Messages (TIM), Probe messages and Basic Safety Messages (BSM).
