## Pattern E1: Cryptographic Key Generation 

Ensures that ITS devices generate and store private/public key pairs securely on the device itself. This pattern supports device authentication, message integrity, and data confidentiality by embedding trust at the hardware level. Generating keys locally eliminates the need to transmit private keys, reducing exposure risk. It also enables strong binding between the cryptographic identity and the physical device.  This pattern is foundational to maintaining trust in message authentication, certificate provisioning, and secure communication in V2X environments.

ITS devices are configured to generate and store cryptographic key pairs used for digital signatures. These keys enable message receivers to validate the identity of the sender and confirm the integrity of the message content. Key generation should occur on the device to reduce the risk of key exposure. Each key pair includes a private key, which must be kept secure, and a public key, which can be shared freely.

Do not allow the private key to be exported from the device. If compromised, it can be used to impersonate the device in any V2X transaction. The public key, in contrast, is designed for distribution and is shared through digital certificates issued by a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Other devices and services use the public key to authenticate signed messages or encrypt data sent to the device.

##### Implementation Context

Used in Roadside Units (RSUs), Onboard Units (OBUs), and trusted backend components that participate in V2X messaging, session establishment, or certificate-based authentication. Commonly implemented during device onboarding or factory initialization.

## Pattern E2: Secure Device Configuration 

Defines a baseline approach to configuring ITS devices securely prior to deployment. This pattern reduces the attack surface by disabling non-essential features, enforcing secure administrative access, and applying controls that ensure only trusted software is allowed to run. It also supports long-term operational security through auditability and revalidation of configuration state.

##### Implementation Context

Used during manufacturing, onboarding, and field installation of devices such as RSUs, OBUs, controllers, and gateways. Also relevant during firmware updates, reimaging, or maintenance activities.

- Operators should validate configuration status prior to device activation using tools or procedures compatible with the deployment model (e.g., CLI, RESTCONF, NETCONF, vendor interface).
- Devices should support secure remote management using mutually authenticated sessions (e.g., TLS 1.3 with client certificates).
- Secure boot status and configuration integrity should be remotely verifiable where possible.

## Pattern E3: Tamper Detection and Response 

Ensures that ITS devices are equipped with hardware-based protections that detect and respond to unauthorized physical access or environmental anomalies. Tamper detection mechanisms should trigger protective actions, such as logging the event or securely erasing keys if physical compromise is suspected. Tamper resistance ensures trust in devices even when they are deployed in unmonitored or high-risk locations.

##### Implementation Context

Applies to all field-deployed ITS components, including OBUs, RSUs, and controllers that store cryptographic credentials. Especially relevant for devices installed in physically accessible environments where physical security cannot be assumed.

##### Key Components

| Component                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Secure Hardware Modules  | Devices must use tamper-resistant components (e.g., HSMs, TPMs, secure elements) to protect keys and execute cryptographic functions. |
| Tamper Sensors           | Devices include physical or electronic sensors to detect intrusion attempts (e.g., voltage fluctuation, casing breach) |
| Zeroization Mechanisms   | If tampering is detected, the device automatically erases keys and sensitive configuration data. |
| Tamper Event Logging     | Events must be recorded locally and transmitted to backend monitoring systems upon detection. |
| Procurement Verification | Procurement and vendor validation processes must confirm the presence of tamper response capabilities and hardware key isolation. |

##### Implementation Details

- Cryptographic key material must be generated and stored within secure elements or equivalent tamper-resistant components.
- Tamper sensors may include switches, mesh detection layers, accelerometers, or voltage anomaly detectors.
- Upon triggering a tamper event, devices must:
  - Invalidate or erase stored private keys.
  - Log the event using a secure, non-volatile mechanism.
- Operators must validate tamper resistance through testing, certification (e.g., FIPS 140-3), or vendor documentation before deployment.

##### Example Use Cases

| Scenario                    | Behavior Enforced                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

## Pattern E4: ITS Station Access Control 

This pattern defines how ITS Station Operators configure and enforce local policies that determine which messages, devices, and applications are permitted to interact with an ITS Station. Access control is implemented through policy-based filtering of message attributes, certificate fields, and interface traffic to ensure only authorized services can be invoked.

By evaluating each connection or message against locally defined rules, including PSIDs/ ITS-AIDs, SSPs, and certificate validity, this pattern prevents unauthorized or malformed data from reaching higher-layer functions. Access controls may also block or limit device interactions based on network origin, time of day, or operational roles.

##### Implementation Context

This pattern applies at the edge of the ITS Station, where local enforcement decisions are made before messages or connections are processed further. ITS Station Operators configure access policies during provisioning and maintain them throughout the lifecycle of the station. These policies are enforced within the device firmware or trusted software, ideally supported by vendor-provided tools and validation routines

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unauthorized Application Attempt | An RSU receives a message with an unrecognized PSID and drops it without processing. |
| Expired Certificate Detected     | An inbound message includes an expired certificate and is rejected by the station. |
| Misconfigured SSP Filter         | A vehicle sends a signal request without the correct SSP; the RSU denies the request. |
| Port Scanning Prevention         | TCP ports not used by the RSUâ€™s services are blocked by default at the network layer. |

| IEEE 1609.3 | Describes network-layer messaging and supported protocols.   |



## Pattern E5: Anomaly Detection and Logging

This pattern enables ITS deployments to identify unusual system behavior that may indicate a cyberattack, policy violation, or device malfunction. Anomalies are detected through local inspection of message content, system states, or operational patterns, and are logged in structured, tamper-resistant formats. Logs are either stored locally or forwarded to a backend system for centralized analysis and response coordination.

##### Implementation Context

This pattern applies across ITS devices, particularly OBUs, RSUs, and backend services that enforce security policies or observe message flows. Detection logic can include policy-based filters, plausibility checks, or statistical anomaly thresholds. Devices must log key security events locally and support export via secure interfaces to backend monitoring systems.

Backends must aggregate logs from multiple sources, correlate behavior across time and geography, and prioritize events that warrant operational response. Operators should implement log retention, access control, and validation practices aligned with regional privacy and audit requirements.

Note: This Pattern is separate from the local misbehavior detection pattern, which focuses on identification of misbehaving vehicles and infrastructure. Pattern E2 is important for basic security event detection, such as malware detection, unauthorized access, etc.

## Pattern E6: Software Integrity Verification and Secure Boot 

Software integrity verification and secure boot prevent unauthorized or modified code from executing on ITS Stations. These mechanisms enforce a chain of trust from device startup through operational runtime by validating that all software and firmware components originate from trusted sources and remain unaltered.

Secure boot verifies digital signatures on firmware and software images at each boot stage. If signatures are missing or invalid, the boot process is halted or redirected to a safe recovery state. This process ensures that only authorized, vendor-approved software runs on field-deployed devices such as RSUs, OBUs, and roadside controllers.

ITS Station Operators must verify that vendors support secure boot and signed software updates. Devices must include hardware or firmware-based enforcement mechanisms (e.g., ROM-anchored keys, TPMs, or secure elements) and validate signatures using trusted certificate chains. Software distribution pipelines must be secured to prevent insertion or modification of signed packages.
