# Policy Makers

Policy Makers such as transportation authorities, regulatory agencies, and public-sector executives, play a critical role in shaping ITS cybersecurity posture. Their decisions influence national policy, funding priorities, legal frameworks, and the overall resilience of public transportation infrastructure. Decision makers are responsible for ensuring public safety, mitigating systemic risk, enabling secure cross-border interoperability, and maintaining public trust in connected mobility.

## Strategic Priorities for Policy Makers

### Adopt a Risk-Based Policy Framework
Cybersecurity policy should be driven by a clear understanding of risk: vehicles, roadside infrastructure communication frameworks, and backend systems are all potential targets for cyberattacks that could result in harm. A risk-based approach enables policies to address the most critical threats, such as spoofed messages, denial-of-service attacks on traffic management centers, or the misuse of digital certificates. Policy Makers should ensure that risk assessments are performed regularly, international standards are adopted with a focus on interoperability, and tailored mitigation strategies are put in place to safeguard their specific ITS deployments. 

#### **Regional Considerations**

- European Union: The security policy of the CCMS requires every ITS stakeholder to have a risk management process and a security management system in place. All transport and infrastructure operators in the EU will be subject to generic NIS2 regulation cyber resilience of their major operational processes. This will impact any ITS trust domain. The generic EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) applies to all ICT devices on the market including ITS stations.
- North America: Agencies such as the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Transport Canada provide guidelines for cybersecurity risk management in transportation. For example, in the United States, NIST SP 800-30 provides a guide for conducting risk assessments that can be applied to ITS systems.  

#### **Recommended Actions**

- Incorporate threat modeling to understand attack vectors and mitigate risks.
- Implement and enforce cybersecurity reporting obligations for transportation operators to share key cybersecurity event information across stakeholders.

## Balancing Security with Usability and Operational Continuity
Cybersecurity measures should have limited impact on the usability, efficiency, and reliability of transportation systems. This is a complex, multifaceted challenge that requires requires balancing security with usability. Key challenges include: 

- Security controls that slow down V2X message exchanges may introduce unacceptable latency issues.
- Security processes must balance driver privacy.
- Incident response mechanisms must be designed to minimize service disruptions.

#### **Regional Considerations**
- EU: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict privacy requirements on data collection and storage.
- North America: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) promotes best practices for secure and resilient ITS deployments.

#### **Recommended Actions**
- Implement privacy-preserving security mechanisms, such as pseudonym certificates.
- Ensure that systems are resilient to ensure continuity in the event of a cyberattack.
