![ISO Standards Process](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/get_involved/img/Illust-The%20process2.svg)

`How to discover the ISO member in your country`

:   You can find the NSB for your country in the [ISO members list](https://www.iso.org/about/members), where each member is listed with contact details.

`What if my country is not an ISO member?`

:   If your country isn’t an ISO member, you can’t participate directly in ISO technical work through a National Standards Body. However, you can contact ISO directly to explore other ways to get involved or learn more about membership options.
