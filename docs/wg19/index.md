## Management of Electronic Traffic Regulations (METR)

The Management of Electronic Traffic Regulations (METR) document series is intended to provide users access to geo-specific, trustworthy, timely, authoritative, machine-interpretable, traffic and transport related rules enacted by jurisdictional entities, including those who define rules for campuses (i.e., private grounds). This is conceptually shown in Figure 0-1.

METR Concept
///

METR is designed to assist developers and manufacturers of driving automation systems (i.e., automation Levels 1-5) and driver information systems (including those at automation Level 0) to electronically obtain traffic rules to better enable:

1. interacting safely with other road users;
2. following instructions from law enforcement organizations, and those authorized to direct traffic;
3. maintaining smooth and safe flow of traffic; and
4. complying with other rules enacted to support legislative policies (such as environmental protection, noise, manage height and weight restrictions, and societal aspects such as market days, fiestas, pedestrian zones, etc.).

METR is designed to provide a reference framework for the trustworthy distribution of electronic versions of legal traffic rules, however content and application of the traffic rules is outside of the scope of the METR standards and specifications.

## Public-Area Mobile Robots (PMRs)

The ISO 4448 document series is focussed on a specific subset of mobile robots, public-area mobile robots (PMRs), that are designed to operate in less-structured and highly dynamic spaces such as on sidewalks or an airport terminal concourse, and shared with bystanders such as pedestrians, cyclists, and automobiles that are uninvolved, unprotected, untrained, and potentially inattentive.

PMRs often need to navigate on road crossings, bike lanes or among vulnerable users such as pedestrians, wheelchair users, or micro-mobility users. To improve the safety and efficiency of this navigation, PMR need to be able to communicate with these other road users. The PMR document series addresses various aspects of the PMR technology space.
