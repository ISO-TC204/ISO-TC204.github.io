### Overview <!-- Optional -->
<!-- On a new line below, provide an overview of the subject area for the associated group of standards. -->
The ISO 24315 series on the management of electronic traffic regulations (METR) is intended to provide users access to geo-specific, trustworthy, timely, authoritative and machine-interpretable rules relating to traffic and transport, enacted by jurisdictional entities, including those who define rules for campuses (i.e. private grounds).

**Abstract:**

This document defines terms specific to the ISO 24315 series on the management of electronic transport regulations.

### Description

The scope of METR includes both rules that are relatively static (e.g. static speed limits) as well as those that are dynamic (e.g. variable speed limits, signalized intersections). Where appropriate, METR incorporates existing documents (e.g. ISO/TS 19091 for signalized intersections).

### Relationships to other standards

**Abstract:**

The purpose of this document is to describe the operational concept (ConOps) for METR. A ConOps is a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users’ viewpoint. It includes a description of the key stakeholders along with the processes and data flows required to fulfil their responsibilities. It describes what the system will do (not how it will do it) and why (rationale). The ConOps is used to communicate overall quantitative and qualitative system characteristics to the acquirer, user, supplier, and other organizational elements (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148). The ConOps is a critical tool in building consensus among stakeholders.
