# About ISO Documents

## Document Types

Every document produced by ISO/TC 204 is generally classified as one of the following:

- **International Standard (IS):** A document that defines requirements for implementations and is considered to be stable. IS documents are reviewed every five years
- **Technical Specification (TS):** A document that defines requirements for implementations but is considered to address a new topic; therefore, it should be recognized that as the topic area matures, changes are more likely to occur in future editions. TS documents are reviewed every three years and are typically elevated to IS documents on the first or second review cycle.
- **Technical Report (TR):** A document that provides information but does not contain any requirements. TR documents can provide justification for other documents, reports on the state of the industry, offer explanations on new technologies, or provide other useful information. TR documents are reviewed periodically as needed.

## Naming Convention for TC204 Deliverables

Our document titles may seem a little daunting, however they typically use the multi-level naming structure:

`<Publishing SDO(s)>`/`<Deliverable Type>` `<Number[-Part]>`:`<Year of Publication>`[(`<language>`)] `<Title 1>` - `<Title 2>` [ - `<Title 3>`]
