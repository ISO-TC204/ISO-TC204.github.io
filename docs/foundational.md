# TC 204 Foundational Standards

The following standards effectively establish the foundation upon which most other TC204 standards are (or should be) built. It is highly recommended that all practitioners are familiar with these standards:

??? "Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector"
    ISO 14813 Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector

    - [Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services](https://www.iso.org/standard/85840.html) [(view sample)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#!iso:std:85840:en)
    - [Part 5: Requirements for architecture description in ITS standards](https://www.iso.org/standard/73746.html)"
    - [Part 6: Use of ASN.1](https://www.iso.org/standard/69109.html)
