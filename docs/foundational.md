## TC204 Foundational Standards

The following standards effectively establish the foundation upon which most other TC204 standards are (or should be) built. It is **highly recommended** that all practitioners (and standards authors) obtain a copy of the following standards:

1. **âœ… Architectural Framework** standards _on this page_
2. **âœ… Other foundational** standards _on this page_ relating to your specific area of interest

<!-- Each section below also contains links (to _other pages_) for standards more specifically focussed on your respective area of interest. Alternately you may prefer to browse directly in your [domain of interest](wg1/index.md).-->

We have also identified a number of [external sites](resources.md) that offer **_packages of standards_** from ISO and other SDO's for purchase.

You may also find it helpful to refer to our quick table of [common terms and acronyms](vocab.md).
