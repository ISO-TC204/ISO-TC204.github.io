## About ISO/TC204 Intelligent Transport Systems
### Overview
Since our establishment in 1992, TC204 has developed and maintained a suite of standards and other artefacts for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) environment that generally exists OUTSIDE a vehicle, and interfaces to the ITS environment INSIDE a vehicle. 
<!-- I think it would be helpful to include an image that helps illustrate this -->

Our 340\+ active documents collectively describe:
* a common **ITS framework** including: 
	* Reference ITS Architecture 
	* ITS Services 
	* Terminology and Definitions
	* Data Concepts (\[\[CIDCR\]\])
	* Registries of ITS Information (RITSI)
* many specialised deliverables that describe and define various components that help deliver ITS Services and solutions. 

TC204 and our work exists within a much broader operating context requiring collaboration with other developers of related standards, both _within ISO_ (such as [TC22 Road Vehicles](https://www.iso.org/committee/46706.html) and [TC344 Innovative Logisitics](https://www.iso.org/committee/9824329.html)) _and beyond_ (such as [CEN/TC278 ITS Standards](https://www.itsstandards.eu/) and [ISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 11 Smart cities](https://jtc1info.org/sd-2-history/jtc1-working-groups/wg-11/)). Our current liaisons are shown below, with links available [here.](https://www.iso.org/committee/54706.html#liaisons)

### TC204 Committee Structure
TC204 delivers its [work programme](https://www.iso.org/contents/data/committee/05/47/54706/x/catalogue/p/0/u/1/w/0/d/0) through a broad range of groups consisting of:
* **WG** - Working Groups within TC204
* **AG** - Advisory Groups (typically special projects / initiatives)
* **JWG** - Joint Working Groups to formally collaborate with experts outside of TC204 (such as other ISO/TCs or other SDOs). 

Our structure is shown below together with our Participating and Observing members. All of [TC204’s groups and convenors](https://www.iso.org/committee/54706.html#structure) may be approached via the [TC204 Secretariat.](https://www.iso.org/committee/54706.html#secretariat)

<ins>JWG1 activities include:</ins>
* Identifying transportation data defined in TC204 that might be relevant outside the transportation domain
* Defining transportation data of external interest in a format conforming to the patterns established in ISO/IEC 5087-1, 5087-2

This encompasses the broad range of travel modes in urban and interurban areas using different communication means. End-users should have easy access to complete information about their travel alternatives and accurate information on current and expected road and travel conditions to enhance their mobility. Part of the work items are developed in common with CEN/TC 278/WG4 “Traffic and traveller information”.

•	The first generation with the ISO/TS 18234 series for binary content and the 24530 series for XML-based content.
•	The second generation that has superseded the first one with the ISO 21219 series.
•	The graphical data dictionary (ISO 14823 series) intends to propose a system of standardised codes for existing road traffic signs and pictograms used to deliver traffic and traveller information. The coding system can be used in the formation of messages within intelligent transport systems.

Working Group 14 Vehicle/roadway warning and control systems

The purpose of WG 14 is to standardize general system aspects of advanced driver
support systems (i.e., collision warning and control assistance systems), and driving
