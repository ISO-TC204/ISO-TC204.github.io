ISO/TC 204 manages over 330 documents. With so many documents - it can be daunting to know where to start?! So start right here for a brief introduction... 
## About TC204 
### Overview
Over many years TC204 has developed and maintained a suite of standards and other artefacts for the ITS environment that exists OUTSIDE the vehicle. Our deliverables collectively describe:
* a common **ITS framework** including: 
	* Reference ITS Architecture 
	* ITS Services 
	* Terminology and Definitions
	* Data Concepts (\[\[CIDCR\]\])
	* Registries of ITS Information (RITSI)
* many specialised deliverables that describe and define various components that help deliver Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Services and solutions. 

### TC204 Committee Structure
TC204 delivers its [work programme](https://www.iso.org/contents/data/committee/05/47/54706/x/catalogue/p/0/u/1/w/0/d/0) through a broad range of working groups consisting of:
* WG - Working Groups within TC204
* AG - Advisory Groups (typically special projects / initiatives)
* JWG - Joint Working Groups to formally collaborate with experts outside of TC204 (such as other ISO/TCs or other SDOs). 

A complete list of TC204’s groups can be found [here](https://www.iso.org/committee/54706.html#structure).

### Naming Convention for TC204 Deliverables 
Our document titles can sometimes seem a little daunting, but TC204 deliverables use a multi-level naming structure, for example:
*  **ISO/TS 14813-1:2015(en) Intelligent transport systems — Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector - Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services**<br>(a sample of this Technical standard is available [here](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:14813:-1:ed-2:v1:en))

While the naming structures may have changed a little over many years, new deliverables follow the current structure as described in the table below...

`<Publishing SDO/s>/<Deliverable Type> <Number[-Part]>:<Year of Publication>(<language>) <Title 1> - <Title 2> [ - <Title 3>]`

|Name Component|Example|Description|
|<Publishing SDO/s>|**ISO**|The Standards Development Organisation/s (SDO) that will publish the deliverable|
|<Deliverable Type> |**TS**|The [types of ISO deliverables](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm)|
|<Number[-Part]>|**14813-1**|Unique identifier of the deliverable, which can include an optional *Part* number to indicate they are focussed components detailing a specific aspect. This can also facilitate progressive development and publishing and use of a suite of documents over time.|
|<Year of Publication>|**2015**|Year that the deliverable is formally published and released for use by ISO|
|<language>|**(en)**|Used to distinguish between **en** (English) and **fr** *(*French) editions of a document|
|<Title 1>|**Intelligent transport systems** |Most of our deliverables now use the name of TC204 for the top tier <Title 1>|
|<Title 2>|**Reference model architecture(s) for the ITS sector**|Key concept|
|<Title 3>|**Part 1: ITS service domains, service groups and services**|The <Title 3> level is optional, but is frequently used in order to describe specific aspects of the Key concept. Note that “Part 1: “ is considered part of the title|
