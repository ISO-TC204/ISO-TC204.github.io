## About ISO/TC204 Intelligent Transport Systems
### Overview
Since our establishment in 1992, TC204 has developed and maintained a suite of standards and other artefacts for the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) environment that generally exists OUTSIDE a vehicle, and interfaces to the ITS environment INSIDE a vehicle. 
<!-- I think it would be helpful to include an image that helps illustrate this -->

Our 340\+ active documents collectively describe:
* a common **ITS framework** including: 
	* Reference ITS Architecture 
	* ITS Services 
	* Terminology and Definitions
	* Data Concepts (\[\[CIDCR\]\])
	* Registries of ITS Information (RITSI)
* many specialised deliverables that describe and define various components that help deliver ITS Services and solutions. 

TC204 and our work exists within a much broader operating context requiring collaboration with other developers of related standards, both _within ISO_ (such as [TC22 Road Vehicles](https://www.iso.org/committee/46706.html) and [TC344 Innovative Logisitics](https://www.iso.org/committee/9824329.html)) _and beyond_ (such as [CEN/TC278 ITS Standards](https://www.itsstandards.eu/) and [ISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 11 Smart cities](https://jtc1info.org/sd-2-history/jtc1-working-groups/wg-11/)). Our current liaisons are shown below, with links available [here.](https://www.iso.org/committee/54706.html#liaisons)

### TC204 Committee Structure
TC204 delivers its [work programme](https://www.iso.org/contents/data/committee/05/47/54706/x/catalogue/p/0/u/1/w/0/d/0) through a broad range of groups consisting of:
* **WG** - Working Groups within TC204
* **AG** - Advisory Groups (typically special projects / initiatives)
* **JWG** - Joint Working Groups to formally collaborate with experts outside of TC204 (such as other ISO/TCs or other SDOs). 

Our structure is shown below together with our Participating and Observing members.
