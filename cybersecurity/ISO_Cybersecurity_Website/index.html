<h2 id="start-here-introduction-to-its-cybersecurity-a-beginners-guide">Start Here: <a href="../dummys-guide/">Introduction to <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Cybersecurity – A Beginner's Guide</a><a class="headerlink" href="#start-here-introduction-to-its-cybersecurity-a-beginners-guide" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Begin with this introductory guide to understand why <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>-specific security mechanisms—such as IEEE 1609.2—are designed to meet the unique requirements of vehicular networks, and why conventional internet security frameworks like X.509 may not be sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="regional-considerations-understand-regional-differences-in-regulation-and-approach">Regional Considerations: <a href="../Regional-considerations/">Understand regional differences in regulation and approach</a><a class="headerlink" href="#regional-considerations-understand-regional-differences-in-regulation-and-approach" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity standards aim for global interoperability, implementation often varies across regions due to different legal frameworks, privacy expectations, governance models, and deployment architectures. These differences directly affect how trust is established, how permissions are granted, and how secure communications are managed. Understanding regional approaches—such as the Security Credential Management System (SCMS) model in North America and the C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Trust Model in Europe—is important for organizations deploying cross-border systems or designing interoperable <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> devices and services.  These differences must be taken into account when designing systems intended for multi-regional interoperability.</p>

<h2 id="key-topics-in-its-cybersecurity">Key Topics in <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Cybersecurity<a class="headerlink" href="#key-topics-in-its-cybersecurity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-its-security-architectures">1. <a href="../its-security-architectures/"><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Security Architectures</a><a class="headerlink" href="#1-its-security-architectures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity architectures define how security protections are applied across devices, vehicles, communications networks, and backend systems. These architectures provide a structured approach to managing digital trust, securing data exchanges, and protecting infrastructure components. They incorporate regional models, such as the SCMS used in North America and the C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Trust Model adopted in Europe, each of which applies different governance structures and cryptographic processes. Standards such as IEEE 1609.2, ISO 21177, and ETSI TS 103 097 form the foundation for securing V2X messaging and managing certificate-based trust. This section outlines how these components and standards are integrated to enable secure and interoperable <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments.  A key focus is the use of public key infrastructures to support secure messaging. </p>
<h3 id="2-security-standards-and-their-roles">2. <a href="../security-standards/">Security Standards and Their Roles</a><a class="headerlink" href="#2-security-standards-and-their-roles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This section outlines key international standards that enable <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity across different layers of the system. It explains how standards define certificate formats, secure message structures, revocation processes, and permission models used to control authorized behavior in <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments. Regional implementations often profile or extend these standards to meet specific requirements. For example, the SCMS architecture in North America applies a profile of IEEE-based standards for certificate and permissions management, while the C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> model in Europe leverages ETSI-defined formats and uses the CPOC protocol for onboarding Root Certificate Authorities. Understanding the role of each standard helps implementers select the appropriate specifications for their technical and regional needs.</p>
<h3 id="3-interoperability-strategies">3. <a href="../trust-bridges/">Interoperability Strategies</a><a class="headerlink" href="#3-interoperability-strategies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Trust bridges are mechanisms that enable secure communication between independent security domains. They are used when two systems operate under separate certificate authorities, trust policies, or technical standards. Trust bridges help establish a common framework for validating credentials, enabling interoperability across domains that may use different cybersecurity models, bridging between systems based on X.509, IEEE 1609.2 or ETSI TS 103 097 formats. This is especially important in cross-jurisdictional deployments, such as where regional <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> infrastructures must exchange authenticated messages despite using distinct certificate management systems. Trust bridges can also support selective trust, allowing one domain to recognize only specific permissions or roles from another domain.</p>
<h3 id="4-its-cybersecurity-mechanisms-and-building-blocks">4. <a href="../system-specific-security/"><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Cybersecurity Mechanisms and Building Blocks</a><a class="headerlink" href="#4-its-cybersecurity-mechanisms-and-building-blocks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Cybersecurity systems and components provide the building blocks that can be used to create a cybersecurity architecture for individual <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems.  These include core security services such as certificate issuance, revocation, and permissions management, which ensure that only authorized entities can participate in communications. Trust is anchored by entities like Electors in the SCMS model or Root Certificate Authorities in the C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> model, each governing certificate validation within their domain. Misbehavior detection capabilities support real-time monitoring and response, identifying suspicious activity such as implausible Basic Safety Messages or message patterns that deviate from expected norms. Finally, protections for OBUs, RSUs, and backend systems ensure that credentials remain secure and communications are authenticated. Together, these components enable a scalable and adaptable cybersecurity architecture for <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="5-stakeholder-specific-guidance">5. <a href="../stakeholder-guidance/">Stakeholder-Specific Guidance</a><a class="headerlink" href="#5-stakeholder-specific-guidance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This section provides guidance tailored to different stakeholder perspectives, helping decision-makers, standards developers, and implementers identify processes, standards, and practices to secure <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments while addressing regional variations in architecture and trust management. Guidance is included for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision-makers</strong>, who play a key role in enabling trust infrastructure. This may include supporting the deployment of a national SCMS in North America or participating in Root CA onboarding processes within the European C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> framework. Decision makers focus on defining secure operational priorities for <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems of systems. </li>
<li><strong>Standards developers</strong>, who must ensure cross-border alignment with international specifications such as ISO 21177, while also addressing regional profiles and extensions, including IEEE 1609.2.1 in North America and ETSI TS 103 097 in Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Implementers</strong>, who are responsible for applying these standards during deployment. This includes tasks such as deploying RSUs, managing PSID and SSP entitlements, and enforcing security policies at the device and network level.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-security-governance">6. <a href="../security-policies/">Security Governance</a><a class="headerlink" href="#6-security-governance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This section addresses governance considerations that guide the secure operation of <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems throughout the device and certificate lifecycle. Topics include certificate enrollment, management, and revocation processes, along with mechanisms to ensure cross-jurisdictional interoperability and adherence to privacy regulations. Governance models vary by region but often include formal structures such as elector-based approval policies in North America’s SCMS and defined onboarding procedures for Root CAs in Europe’s C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>. Additional examples include end entity security requirements for OBUs and RSUs, and policy controls that govern how permissions (such as PSIDs and SSPs) are issued and enforced.</p>
<h3 id="7-specialized-use-cases">7. <a href="../specialized-use-cases/">Specialized Use Cases</a><a class="headerlink" href="#7-specialized-use-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This section presents targeted examples that illustrate how cybersecurity measures are applied to specific <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> technologies and message types. Use cases include emerging system architectures such as Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), where secure communication and trust management are critical to safe and efficient operation. At the message level, the section highlights how protections are implemented for key V2X message types such as Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), Traveler Information Messages (TIMs), and Probe Data Messages. These examples help demonstrate how security standards and policies are tailored to meet the unique operational and trust requirements of different <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> functions.</p>

<p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>) enhance mobility and safety through connected and automated technologies. <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> relies on real-time data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud-based services to optimize traffic flow and improve vehicular safety. Connected vehicles use vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to help prevent collisions, while roadside units (RSUs) relay critical information such as signal phase changes, work zone alerts, and dynamic speed limits. Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables rapid decision-making by processing data close to the roadway, reducing latency for safety-critical applications. The following diagram illustrates the key components of a typical <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployment and how they interact as a system of systems.</p>
<p><img alt="ITS Environment" src="C:/Users/bruss/OneDrive - TrustThink, LLC/Projects - TrustThink, LLC/ITS JPO/2025 Year/ISO Cybersecurity Website/Development/ISO-TC204.github.io/docs/cybersecurity/images/its_generic.jpg" /></p>
<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> is not a single system, but a system of systems, including vehicles, sensors, infrastructure, communications networks, and backend platforms—that must cooperate in real time. The complexity and interconnectedness of these systems create new operational benefits but also introduce new types of risk. Because vehicles and infrastructure often interact dynamically and at high speeds, reliability, precision, and trust in communications are essential.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is the protection of digital systems, communications, and data from unauthorized access, manipulation, or disruption. In critical infrastructure sectors such as transportation, cybersecurity safeguards systems that directly affect physical safety. A cybersecurity failure could disrupt traffic signals, disable roadside infrastructure, or compromise the behavior of a connected vehicle on the road. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity principles include confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access, preserving privacy and preventing misuse. Integrity guarantees that data and messages remain accurate and unaltered during transmission or storage. Availability ensures that systems and services remain operational and accessible when needed. In transportation, these principles apply to traffic control commands, vehicle messaging, digital road signage, and other systems. In such cases, timing, accuracy, and authentication of source or destination entities are critical</p>

<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data exchanged across an <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> system of systems. It protects against cyber threats that could disrupt traffic management, compromise vehicle behavior, or manipulate digital traffic controls. This includes securing communication between vehicles and infrastructure, ensuring that only trusted devices participate in <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> applications, and protecting sensitive data from misuse or exposure.</p>
<p>Modern <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> environments face a broad and evolving threat landscape. Communications between vehicles and infrastructure—known as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)—must be protected from interception, manipulation, and unauthorized injection of false data. Network infrastructure is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) and malware-based attacks, which can disable roadside systems or overwhelm traffic management centers. IoT devices such as smart traffic signals, cameras, and sensors may be physically or remotely exploited due to weak default configurations or unpatched software. Location-based services can be compromised through GPS spoofing and jamming, causing vehicles to misreport their positions or lose navigation capability. As cyber-physical systems, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments must defend not just against digital exploits, but against threats that have direct safety consequences in the physical world—from manipulating emergency vehicle priority to triggering unsafe driving conditions. The following diagram provides a simplified view of the types of threats that can affect different components of the <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> environment.</p>
<p><img alt="ITS Ecosystem Threats" src="C:/Users/bruss/OneDrive - TrustThink, LLC/Projects - TrustThink, LLC/ITS JPO/2025 Year/ISO Cybersecurity Website/Development/ISO-TC204.github.io/docs/cybersecurity/images/its_threats.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unlike traditional internet-based systems, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity must function in highly mobile, latency-sensitive environments where anonymity of participants is often important. Vehicles must trust messages from other vehicles or roadside systems they have never encountered before—often with no direct internet connection or central authority available at the time of interaction. As a result, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> requires specialized cybersecurity tools and protocols that go beyond traditional cybersecurity tools such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates. The sections that follow introduce the unique characteristics of <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity, explain why general-purpose cybersecurity tools are insufficient, and describe the standards and trust frameworks that support secure <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments. </p>

<p>Transportation systems integrate real-time cyber-physical operations with direct safety implications. Unlike traditional IT systems, which can often tolerate latency, centralized trust models, and identity-bound certificates, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> requires decentralized, privacy-preserving, and low latency security models that operate across jurisdictions. These systems support millions of highly mobile vehicles and infrastructure components that must be able to securely interact often without continuous connectivity.</p>
<p>While <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>-specific security mechanism such as those defined in IEEE 1609.2 or ETSI TS 103 09 were developed to meet these needs, it is important to understand why traditional internet security protocols like X.509 and TLS are often not appropriate. The characteristics below highlight the specific challenges that make <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity a distinct field of practice.</p>

      ITS involve real-time interactions that directly affect safety. For example, vehicle-to-Road Side Unit (RSU) communication requires minimal latency so that vehicles can immediately process messages. Any delays that would be introduced through traditional internet security protocols, which are often optimized for less time-sensitive applications, could lead to safety hazards. ITS-specific mechanisms, such as IEEE Std. 1609.2 certificates, are designed to prioritize low-latency communication while maintaining security, making them better suited for safety-critical real-time operations.

These mechanisms enable the extension of trust to differing policy domains and support the dynamic operation of vehicles with infrastructures owned and managed by differing entities. Generic systems like X.509 lack these built-in cross-trust mechanisms and require substantial planning and processes for trust extension, making them less suited for managing complex ITS trust requirements.

Assertion of specific PSID/SSP values in an IEEE 1609.2 certificate ensures that only authorized subscribers are able to perform specific actions, such as requesting traffic signal priority or accessing sensitive data. Well-defined PSID/SSP profiles allow an ITS to enforce fine-grained authorization and access control.

In past incidents, ransomware attacks on transportation agencies have shut down traffic management centers, preventing operators from monitoring road conditions. Additionally, researchers have demonstrated remote exploits on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, allowing attackers to inject false vehicle attributes into Basic Safety Messages (BSM). These threats require ITS-specific security measures, such as misbehavior detection and certificate-based authentication and privileging, that are not provided via X.509 certificates.

<p>Now that we've established what makes <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity unique, it's useful to introduce the key mechanisms that have been developed to meet those needs. These mechanisms include secure certificate formats tailored for mobile use, frameworks for distributing and managing credentials across millions of devices, and systems for detecting and responding to misbehavior in the network. While specific implementations vary by region—for example, between North America’s SCMS and Europe’s CCMS—the core building blocks share common goals and are aligned with international standards.</p>
<p>The following section provides a high-level overview of these mechanisms, written for non-experts. More technical readers are encouraged to explore the <a href="../system-specific-security/"><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Cybersecurity Mechanisms and Building Blocks</a> section for deeper background.</p>
<h3 id="credential-management-systems">Credential Management Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#credential-management-systems" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A Credential Management System (SCMS or CCMS) is a specialized type of public key infrastructure (PKI) designed for <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>. It provides the foundation of trust for communications between vehicles, infrastructure, and backend systems. Unlike traditional PKI systems that issue long-term identity certificates, SCMS and CCMS issue short-lived pseudonym certificates that protect user privacy while still enabling strong authentication and authorization. The diagram below introduces the core components of a credential management system used to enable trusted communication in <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>.</p>
<p><img alt="Public Key Infrastructure" src="C:/Users/bruss/OneDrive - TrustThink, LLC/Projects - TrustThink, LLC/ITS JPO/2025 Year/ISO Cybersecurity Website/Development/ISO-TC204.github.io/docs/cybersecurity/images/pki.jpg" /></p>
<p>These systems include processes for certificate issuance, renewal, revocation, and trust distribution. They also support cross-jurisdictional trust, using structures like Certificate Trust Lists (CTLs) or European Certificate Trust Lists (ECTLs) to allow vehicles and devices from different organizations or countries to interoperate securely.</p>
<h3 id="its-certificate-standards"><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Certificate Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#its-certificate-standards" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> uses certificate formats specifically tailored for the real-time, decentralized, and mobile nature of V2X communications. Two major standards are used globally: IEEE 1609.2, which is primarily deployed in North America, and ETSI TS 103 097, which is used in Europe. While developed in parallel, both standards share key features that address the specific challenges of <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>. They support privacy-preserving pseudonymity, allowing vehicles to authenticate messages without revealing long-term identities. They also include geolocation constraints and flexible permission structures that enable fine-grained control over what actions a device is authorized to perform. </p>
<h3 id="entitlements">Entitlements<a class="headerlink" href="#entitlements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> certificates can carry embedded entitlements—policy assertions that define what a device is authorized to do in the context of specific <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> applications. These entitlements are expressed using certificate fields such as the Provider Service Identifier (PSID) and Service-Specific Permissions (SSP) in IEEE deployments, or the <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Application Identifier (<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>-<abbr title="Application IDentifier">AID</abbr>) and corresponding permissions in ETSI-based systems. For example, a certificate may include an entitlement that authorizes a vehicle to request signal priority, while restricting that capability from others. By supporting fine-grained entitlements, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> certificates enable strong access control mechanisms that align with specific use cases, user roles, or organizational policies.</p>
<h3 id="misbehavior-detection">Misbehavior Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#misbehavior-detection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Even in a well-secured system, trusted devices can malfunction or behave maliciously. In <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>, where safety depends on the accuracy and integrity of real-time data, it is important to continuously evaluate whether participants are acting in accordance with expected behaviors. Misbehavior detection systems are designed to identify faulty or deceptive behavior, for example  inconsistent vehicle position updates, spoofed GPS signals, or invalid safety alerts, and initiate a response that preserves trust in the network. These systems operate at both the edge and the backend. Local detection capabilities onboard vehicles or infrastructure can flag suspicious messages, while backend authorities analyze reported incidents, corroborate evidence, and determine whether a device's credentials should be suspended or revoked. The figure below illustrates a simplified view of how misbehavior is detected, validated, and responded to in a credential-based <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> environment.</p>
<p><img alt="MisbehaviorLifecycle" src="C:/Users/bruss/OneDrive - TrustThink, LLC/Projects - TrustThink, LLC/ITS JPO/2025 Year/ISO Cybersecurity Website/Development/ISO-TC204.github.io/docs/cybersecurity/images/MisbehaviorLifecycle.jpg" /></p>

<p>Digital security architectures are typically built as layered stacks, with each layer addressing different types of threats and trust requirements. The traditional internet stack, built around protocols such as TLS and certificate formats like X.509, is well-suited for securing static web services, enterprise systems, and client-server communications. <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>, however, operates under fundamentally different constraints. It involves mobile actors, ephemeral trust relationships, and real-time decision-making in safety-critical contexts. These differences have led to the development of an <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>-specific cybersecurity stack—designed for decentralized communication, scalability, privacy, and performance in dynamic environments. The following comparison outlines where each stack is typically applied, and highlights why the <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity stack is better suited for securing V2X and transportation-specific use cases.</p>
<p>Many of the critical differences between traditional internet security and <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity come down to one key architectural choice: the certificate format. Digital certificates define how trust is established, how messages are authenticated, how privacy is preserved, and how permissions are assigned. Traditional internet systems rely on X.509 certificates, which are long-lived, identity-bound, and designed for centralized, session-based environments—such as browsers, enterprise servers, and backend applications. In contrast, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems use specialized certificate formats, such as IEEE 1609.2 (North America) and ETSI TS 103 097 (Europe), which are tailored for real-time communication between mobile devices in safety-critical scenarios.</p>
<p>The table below is intended as a decision tool. It identifies common deployment considerations and helps clarify which certificate format is better suited to address each one. Readers should evaluate each row in the context of their deployment environment and use case.</p>

<p>X.509 certificates are still a valid and widely used option for securing communications in backend systems, including data exchanges between traffic management centers, cloud platforms, and enterprise services. However, for on-road communication, safety-critical applications, and mobility-centric environments, X.509 lacks the necessary support for short-lived credentials, anonymity, decentralized trust, and application-specific permissions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity deployments are shaped by regional differences in legal frameworks, governance models, privacy expectations, and system architecture. These variations influence how trust is established, how anonymity is maintained, and how secure communication occurs across jurisdictions. The following subsections highlight key governance, trust, and compliance differences that influence <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> cybersecurity operations globally.</p>
<h2 id="governance-models">Governance Models<a class="headerlink" href="#governance-models" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Regional governance of trust frameworks determines who manages certificate policies, who can issue credentials, and how compliance is enforced.</p>
<p>Europe employs a centralized governance model under the European Commission. The Certificate Policy Authority (CPA) governs root-level decisions, including root CA approvals and revocations. Sub-roles such as the Trust List Manager (TLM) and C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> point of Contact (CPOC) operate in support of CPA decisions. Governance responsibilities include scheduling European Certificate Trust List (ECTL) signing sessions, maintaining policy documents, and managing enrollment requests. </p>
<p>North America employs a multi-entity consensus model. An SCMS Manager relies on a group of Electors to establish trust by signing a Certificate Trust List (CTL). Electors follow criteria established through working groups and committees, such as the Ecosystem Audit Committee (EAC). Each SCMS Provider is responsible for its own certificate issuance processes, subject to periodic compliance review. </p>
<h2 id="trust-frameworks-and-certificate-lifecycle-management">Trust Frameworks and Certificate Lifecycle Management<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-frameworks-and-certificate-lifecycle-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Trust frameworks define how certificates are issued, validated, and revoked across an <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> environment. </p>
<p>In Europe, trust anchors are maintained within the EU CCMS and published as part of the ECTL, which is managed solely by the TLM. All operations, including root CA inclusion, certificate updates, and revocation, are mediated by the CPOC.</p>
<p>In North America, SCMS Providers will typically comply with a set of requirements (e.g., SCMS Provider Requirements) that define audit procedures, certificate usage rules, and requirements for publishing revocation lists and distributing certificate trust lists. Providers are expected to implement their own misbehavior handling processes including revocation policies and procedures. Root CA revocation and approval are handled via Elector-signed CTLs. </p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-anonymity">Privacy and Anonymity<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-and-anonymity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems are designed to prevent long-term tracking and identity exposure by using pseudonym certificates, which are short-term certificates that anonymize the link between individual messages and their originating OBUs. The use of short-lived psuedonym certificates is governed by policy. In Europe, privacy is tightly regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As a result, European C-<abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments emphasize strict data minimization and correlation to identity. Pseudonym certificates are issued and used in a manner that intentionally prevents backend correlation. </p>
<p>In North America, privacy protections are implemented through pseudonymity as well. Certificate are rotated frequently and linkages to vehicle identifies are restricted. </p>
<h3 id="compliance-and-audit">Compliance and Audit<a class="headerlink" href="#compliance-and-audit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In Europe, accredited Root CAs must pass technical and organizational audits  prior to inclusion in the ECTL. </p>
<p>In North America, each SCMS Provider selects an independent PKI auditor to validate conformance with SCMS Manager’s Provider Requirements. Providers must maintain certifications (e.g., ISO 27001 or TISAX), and all Certificate Policy (CP) and Certificate Practices Statement (CPS) documents must reflect the approved policy set. </p>

<h4 id="physical-access-control-and-monitoring">Physical Access Control and Monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-access-control-and-monitoring" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, RSUs, signal controllers, and field cabinets should be enclosed in tamper-resistant housings with alarmed locks, sealed entry points, and environmental monitoring sensors. Physical keys or electronic access controls must be tightly managed under documented procedures, and access events should be logged and reviewed regularly. For backend infrastructure (e.g., TMCs), access should be gated by badge readers, monitored entry points, and facility-level intrusion detection.</p>
<h4 id="secure-hardware-and-cryptographic-protection">Secure Hardware and Cryptographic Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-hardware-and-cryptographic-protection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>All devices that handle cryptographic material (e.g., OBUs, RSUs) should store keys in non-exportable formats using secure elements, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). These components should be validated under FIPS 140-3 or ISO/IEC 19790 (Security Techniques for cryptographic modules) and configured to perform cryptographic operations within isolated hardware. Devices must support tamper response features that erase keys or disable functionality if physical compromise is detected.</p>
<h4 id="firmware-and-interface-security">Firmware and Interface Security<a class="headerlink" href="#firmware-and-interface-security" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Firmware must be cryptographically signed and verified at boot (secure boot), and all debug, USB, and serial interfaces should be disabled or locked before deployment. Any firmware updates should occur only through authenticated channels that verify digital signatures and validate version histories. Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update workflows should be authenticated using certificates. </p>

<h2 id="network-and-transport-layer">Network and Transport Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#network-and-transport-layer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Network and Transport Layer secures the communication channels that carry <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr>/V2X data across both wireless and wired infrastructures. This includes V2X communications between vehicles and RSUs, as well as data flows between field devices and backend systems. The primary function of this layer is to ensure that data in transit is protected against tampering, interception, and unauthorized injection, while also enforcing device authentication and ensuring service availability under adverse conditions.</p>
<p>Standards such as IEEE 1609.3 define network and transport protocols for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), while IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI TS 103 097 provide cryptographic protections through digital signatures and encryption for V2X messages. Backend communications are typically secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3), often with mutual authentication. </p>

<p>To counter these threats, <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> architectures introduce authenticated and encrypted messaging, permissions-based enforcement, strict certificate enrollment policies and procedures, and pseudonymity and anonymity protections. </p>
<h4 id="authenticated-messaging">Authenticated Messaging<a class="headerlink" href="#authenticated-messaging" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>All V2X messages must be digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity. Standards such as IEEE 1609.2.1 and ETSI TS 103 097 define the format for secure message headers, including certificate linkage, timestamps, and replay protection. Devices that cannot validate signatures should discard the message and optionally report the event to backend systems.</p>
<h4 id="encryption">Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#encryption" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>While most V2X safety messages are signed but not encrypted, sensitive messages such as those containing traveler data or backend system configurations should be encrypted in transit. Protocols such as TLS 1.3 should be used for all backend communications between RSUs, TMCs, and service providers. For SCMS certificate requests and policy downloads, encryption ensures confidentiality of device identity. </p>
<h4 id="pseudonymity-and-anonymity-protections">Pseudonymity and Anonymity Protections<a class="headerlink" href="#pseudonymity-and-anonymity-protections" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Pseudonymity protections are designed to prevent vehicles and infrastructure devices from being persistently identified or tracked based on their V2X transmissions. Rather than using a static identity, each device is issued a set of short-term, unlinkable certificates—known as pseudonym certificates—that are rotated frequently. These protections are important to preserve user privacy in connected vehicle environments. Without effective pseudonymity, passive observers could correlate message patterns, locations, and timing to reconstruct vehicle trajectories, profile driver behavior, or infer organizational activities. To mitigate these risks, devices must rotate pseudonym certificates at regular intervals. </p>
<h2 id="application-layer">Application Layer<a class="headerlink" href="#application-layer" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Application Layer is responsible for enabling defined transportation functions, such as signal priority, lane coordination or incident warning. Applications are standardized, certificate-bound services identified by globally or regionally assigned IDs (AAID or PSID) implemented according to strict message structures and access policies. Applications interact with other <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> components using defined message types from standards like SAE J2735 and ETSI EN 302 637-x, and are identified and authorized via Provider Service Identifiers (PSIDs) and Service-Specific Permissions (SSPs).</p>

<h4 id="application-permissions-and-authorization-controls">Application Permissions and Authorization Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#application-permissions-and-authorization-controls" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In connected vehicle systems, application-level permissions are managed through values embedded in digital certificates such as the PSID, which identifies a specific application (e.g., signal priority request), and the SSP, which define what actions a device is authorized to perform within that application. For example, a transit vehicle’s Onboard Unit (OBU) may have a certificate that includes the PSID for the Signal Request Message (SRM) application and an SSP indicating it is authorized to request transit signal priority at intersections. OBUs and RSUs should enforce these permissions when transmitting or receiving messages. Applications should only initiate communication for services they are explicitly authorized for, and roadside infrastructure (e.g., RSUs) must validate both PSID and SSP on incoming messages.</p>
<h4 id="policy-management">Policy Management<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Many <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> applications operate under local or regional policies configured by <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Station Operators (SO) that define where, when, and by whom an application may be used. These rules complement certificate-bound permissions and are defined through deployment policy frameworks implemented by jurisdictions, infrastructure owners, or certificate authorities. Polices may be enforced at multiple points in a system and may be implemented through mechanisms such as geofencing, SSP-encoding, infrastructure logic, and credential life-cycle controls. These mechanisms ensure that applications are not only cryptographically authorized, but also contextually constrained to operate within their intended scope.</p>

<p>The Trust and Identity Layer defines how secure identities are established, validated, and managed throughout the lifecycle of <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> devices and services. This layer underpins all secure communications in <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> environments by maintaining a chain of trust across jurisdictions, devices, and infrastructure.

<h4 id="root-of-trust-management">Root of Trust Management<a class="headerlink" href="#root-of-trust-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certificate management systems such as the SCMS and CCMS provide mechanisms for managing trust within a domain. These systems manage the lifecycle of trust anchors, validate root and intermediate certificate authorities, and enforce policies that define how trust decisions are made, distributed, and revoked across participating entities. In SCMS, Electors play a key role in maintaining the Certificate Trust List (CTL). A quorum of Electors must collectively sign a MultiSignedCTL, which serves as the definitive list of trusted roots and system components. This prevents unilateral changes to the trust structure and ensures that updates are the result of multi-party agreement. Similarly, in Europe’s CCMS, trust is managed through the CPOC process, where new Root CAs are approved and registered through coordinated member state oversight and publishing of the CTL.</p>
<h4 id="enrollment-policy-and-enforcement">Enrollment Policy and Enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#enrollment-policy-and-enforcement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certificate enrollment requires that entities such as OBUs, RSUs and backend systems meet specific end-entity (EE) requirements. These requirements ensure that EEs are capable of securely operating within the transportation system, and may cover topics such as secure key storage, use of FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules, and firmware security. EEs may also be required to undergo testing to determine compliance with any published certificate management system policies. </p>
<h4 id="certificate-lifecycle-controls">Certificate Lifecycle Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#certificate-lifecycle-controls" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certificate lifecycle controls define how digital credentials are issued, updated, rotated, and revoked. These controls ensure that certificates are managed in accordance with cryptographic standards and policy requirements. Certificates are issued by authorized SCMS or CCMS Providers based on strict identity vetting, device compliance, and enrollment validation. Each certificate binds a public key to a role-specific identity (e.g., OBU, RSU, backend service), along with associated permissions and usage constraints. Certificate issuance procedures must be documented in the certificate management service providers' CP and /or CPS. These policies should also detail update and rotation frequencies for different types of certificates as well as revocation processes and procedures. </p>

It plays an important role in maintaining trust across an <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> system of systems. This layer processes data transmitted from vehicles and infrastructure to detect security anomalies and protocol violations.

<p>Trust bridges are mechanisms that enable the secure sharing of information between two independent trust domains. They can facilitate sharing between trust domains with differing security and operating policies, and support bridging between trust domains that rely on different frameworks, such as X.509 and IEEE 1609.2.</p>
<p>The concept of a trust bridge is to enable secure sharing of information across independent trust domains. A trust bridge ensures that data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity are preserved throughout the transfer, even when bridging involves proprietary systems.</p>

<p>Each certificate includes varying fields depending on its type and role. For example, Authorization Tickets (in ETSI) and pseudonym certificates (in SCMS) include permissions that define which messages a device may sign, and the region in which the certificate is valid. A certificate can be explicit, meaning it includes the full public key, or implicit, where only a reconstruction value is stored and the recipient computes the public key. Implicit certificates are smaller. </p>

<p>Misbehavior detection systems evlauate messages for plausibility, consistency, and alignment with expected behavior. Misbehavior detection operates both locally, within vehicles and roadside units, and centrally, through backend authorities that assess incoming reports and take appropriate action.

<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> Cybersecurity requires collaboration across international bodies, national policymakers, standards developers, and deployment implementers. Because <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems involve mobile, decentralized, and real-time communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and backend systems, a shared approach to cybersecurity is essential. This page introduces guidance for three key stakeholder groups: decision-makers, standards developers, and implementers—each of whom plays a unique role in shaping and sustaining cybersecurity for <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> deployments.</p>
<p>To understand how different responsibilities and policy frameworks interact, it's important to recognize the multi-tiered governance structure that supports secure and interoperable <abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> systems:</p>

<p><abbr title="Intelligent Transport Systems">ITS</abbr> certificate management is governed by policy that ensures secure enrollment, use, and revocation of digital certificates.  Most PKI systems perform similar functions: trust management, entitlement enrollment, certificate lifecycle management, and misbehavior response. </p>
<h2 id="trust-management">Trust Management<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Trust anchor management defines how Root Certificate Authorities (RCAs) are authorized and monitored. This process includes approving new trust anchors, auditing existing ones, and distributing updated trust lists to relying parties.  A  distributed trust model may involve Electors who are trusted entitles that vote to approve or revoke RCAs. RCAs then certify intermediate authorities (e.g., Enrollment or Pseudonym CAs). </p>
<p>In the European model, a central policy authority defines certificate policies and oversees Root CA conformance. A designated TLM maintains the trust list, which is distributed to participating entities. Root CA inclusion or removal is based on defined policy and audit compliance. Example roles that may play a part in the overall governance for trust anchor management may include: </p>

<h3 id="scms-trust-management">SCMS Trust Management<a class="headerlink" href="#scms-trust-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the SCMS model, trust anchor management is handled by a distributed group of entities known as Electors. Electors collectively maintain the CTL, which identifies the Root CAs trusted by the system. Changes to the CTL, such as adding or removing a Root CA require approval through an Elector voting process. A quorum of Electors must digitally sign the CTL update before it is accepted by relying components. This mechanism ensures that no single authority can unilaterally alter the trust anchor set.</p>
<h3 id="ccms-trust-management">CCMS Trust Management<a class="headerlink" href="#ccms-trust-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the CCMS model, trust anchor management is coordinated by a centralized governance structure. The CPA defines certificate policies and evaluates Root CAs for inclusion in the ECTL. Following a positive audit or policy evaluation, the CPA transmits its endorsement to the C-POC, which acts as the technical liaison. The C-POC validates submitted Root CA certificates and forwards them to the TLM, a designated entity responsible for maintaining and distributing the signed ECTL. Updates to the ECTL are based exclusively on CPA directives and are digitally signed to ensure authenticity. Devices use the signed ECTL to determine which Root CAs are trusted for secure communication.</p>
<h2 id="entitlement-enrollment">Entitlement Enrollment<a class="headerlink" href="#entitlement-enrollment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Entitlement enrollment refers to the policy-governed process of assigning specific permissions to end entities. These permissions define what V2X services a device is authorized to access and what actions it may perform. Common mechanisms for expressing entitlements include the use of PSID and SSP.  Governance frameworks define how these entitlements are granted and validated. </p>
<h3 id="examples-scms-entitlement-enrollment">Examples - SCMS Entitlement Enrollment<a class="headerlink" href="#examples-scms-entitlement-enrollment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the SCMS model, entitlement enrollment begins with identifying the type and intended function of the device (e.g., safety messaging for an OBU). The system assigns appropriate PSIDs and SSPs in accordance with defined policy. These values are included in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is validated by the Registration Authority (RA) prior to certificate issuance. Entitlements are not managed directly by certificate authorities. They are governed by operational policies that define authorized roles and service access.</p>
<h3 id="example-ccms-entitlements">Example: CCMS Entitlements<a class="headerlink" href="#example-ccms-entitlements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the CCMS model, entitlement information is reviewed and enforced by subordinate CAs operating under a Root CA listed in the ECTL. The CPA that defines entitlement policy and ensures consistency across jurisdictions. </p>
<h2 id="certificate-lifecycle">Certificate Lifecycle<a class="headerlink" href="#certificate-lifecycle" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The certificate lifecycle defines processes through which certificates are issued, renewed, and revoked.  Enrollment establishes initial device trust , followed by the issuance of role-specific operational certificates. Governance frameworks must define eligibility criteria and certificate lifecycle requirements. </p>

<ul>
<li>Enrollment: Devices are provisioned with an Enrollment Certificate , which authorizes them to participate in SCMS-managed services. A CSR is generated and validated by the Registration Authority (RA). The Enrollment Certificate Authority (ECA) issues the certificate, which serves as a bootstrap credential for requesting role-specific certificates. </li>
<li>Issuance: Operational certificates (e.g., pseudonym certificates) are issued based on defined policy. Devices submit requests containing their assigned PSID/SSP entitlements. The issuing CA validates these requests and issues the corresponding certificates based on an approved CP. </li>
<li>Revocation: Revocation policies support the removal of certificates due to misbehavior, compromise, or expiration. Pseudonym certificate revocation is managed through CRLs. Root CA revocations require Elector approval and result in CTL updates. </li>

<ul>
<li>Spoofed messages triggering incorrect maneuvers</li>
<li>Unauthorized devices attempting to participate</li>
<li>Injection of false trajectory or intent data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="probe-data-collection">Probe Data Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#probe-data-collection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Probe data applications collect information such as vehicle speed, heading, or environmental conditions to support traffic analysis and planning. Key risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorized access to collected data</li>
<li>Leakage of personally identifiable or vehicle-identifiable information</li>
<li>Injection of fabricated probe reports</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="road-use-charging-ruc">Road Use Charging (RUC)<a class="headerlink" href="#road-use-charging-ruc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
